Complexity Cat is an initiative created and promoted by Amahury J. Lopez-Diaz, a mexican physicist who wanted to develop a communication channel where young researchers keen on complex systems (and other similar interdisciplinary fields) could be kept posted about the most recent news related to it. This project started as a simple Twitter/X account (@amahury0) which later evolved to the present webpage.
