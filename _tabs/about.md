Since 2023 I started using my Twitter/X account (@amahury0) as a communication channel that seeks to disseminate inter-, trans- and multi-disciplinary science. At first, I focused on transmitting news, papers and essays dedicated to complex systems, theoretical biology, artificial intelligence, linguistics, neuroscience and their intersections. Later, when I had the opportunity to attend different international academic events, I decided to use this channel to follow up on these conferences and summer schools. Today Complexity Cat has evolved into a weekly journalistic blog, an independent and non-profit media that seeks to communicate everything related to complexity science. The structure of Complexity Cat is composed of five columns, each with different purposes, which are described below.
<br/><br/><br/>
  
#### Opinion ####
<br/><br/><br/>
This section is dedicated to the analysis of any material or event related to complex systems. Some of my writings will be introductory, that as a miscellany seek to introduce the curious to the world of complex systems. Others of my essays will be more specialized, seeking to generate constructive criticism that will lead us to an objective and dialectical view of science. Although in principle I would also like to recommend books or articles related to complex systems, I will try to focus my reviews on nteresting material that may not be so well known, giving visibility to high quality underground content.
<br/><br/><br/>
#### Events ####
<br/><br/><br/>
This column seeks to passively share information about conferences, summer schools, workshops, congresses, internships, symposia, special issues or any other event related to complex systems. From time to time I will also announce compendiums or books that have been recently published, the latter with the intention of sharing different perspectives but being agnostic to their content. Complexity Cat will always look for healthy discussions on current topics that can be seen as controversial, debatable and questionable.
<br/><br/><br/>
#### Community ####
<br/><br/><br/>
This column has two purposes. The first is that young researchers can use Complexity Cat as a reference for job searches. Here we will publicize open positions as associate professor/lecturer, postdoctoral researcher opportunities, as well as doctoral and master's degree programs, all focused on complex systems or multidisciplinary science in general. The second goal of this column is to be a networking medium for young researchers. If you are looking for new collaborators, or just to let people know about your work, you can send us a short piece telling us about your background, skills and interests. We will take care of publishing this information and spreading the word on our Twitter/X account (@amahury0). In the near future I would also like to use this section to publish Q&As with researchers with a well established career. The idea is to use such interviews at the same time to disseminate their lines of research and inspire researchers who are just starting out. 
<br/><br/><br/>
#### Glossary ####
\\
Complexity Cat not only seeks to disseminate everything related to complex systems, but also to be an educational medium. To that end, this section is dedicated to compile definitions, models, tools and theories related to complexity science. Being an interdisciplinary field, there are many concepts in the literature that can be ambiguous, redundant or similar to each other (even though they are not related as such). This column seeks to contrast these concepts with each other, following a chronological order and bringing with it historical notes that may help to better understand the context in which these frameworks were developed. 
\\
<br/><br/><br/>
#### Fiction ####
<br/><br/><br/>
Unlike other excellent digital science magazines such as Quanta Magazine, Aeon and Nautilus (from which I took a lot of inspiration for this project), Complexity Cat seeks to be a medium where science and artistic expression can coexist. That is why this section is dedicated primarily to non-academic writing (short tales, chronicles, poetry, etc.) and, at the same time, to the recommendation of multimedia content such as movies, series, music, animation, video games, novels, podcasts, videos and any other form of non-academic expression. If you are interested in publishing a science fiction story or poetry (with your name or under anonymity), feel free to contact us.
<br/><br/><br/>
Complexity Cat is an initiative created and promoted by Amahury J. López-Díaz, a Mexican physicist who wanted to develop a communication channel where young researchers interested in complex systems (and other similar interdisciplinary fields) could keep abreast of the latest news related to them. Currently there are four other people (Ilich S., Daria G., Mario X. and Carlos X.) helping the main creator to review his writings and to develop infographics to share in social media. If possible, the final form of Complexity Cat will be an independent, self-managed, peer-reviewed, open-access, free-of-charge journal, in which reviewers are paid for their valuable work.
