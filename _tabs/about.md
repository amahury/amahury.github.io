Since 2023 I started using my Twitter/X account (@amahury0) as a communication channel that seeks to disseminate inter-, trans- and multi-disciplinary science. At first, I focused on transmitting news, papers and essays dedicated to complex systems, theoretical biology, artificial intelligence, linguistics, neuroscience and their intersections. Later, when I had the opportunity to attend different international academic events, I decided to use this channel to follow up on these conferences and summer schools. Today ***Complexity Cat*** has evolved into a weekly journalistic blog, an independent and non-profit media that seeks to communicate everything related to complexity science. The structure of ***Complexity Cat*** is composed of five columns, each with different purposes, which are described below.
<br/><br/><br/>
- #### **Opinion**
This section is dedicated to the analysis of any material or event related to complex systems. Some of my writings will be introductory, that as a miscellany seek to introduce the curious to the world of complex systems. Others of my essays will be more specialized, seeking to generate constructive criticism that will lead us to an objective and dialectical view of science. Although in principle I would also like to recommend books or articles related to complex systems, I will try to focus my reviews on nteresting material that may not be so well known, giving visibility to high quality underground content.
<br/><br/><br/>
- #### **Events**
This column seeks to passively share information about conferences, summer schools, workshops, congresses, internships, symposia, special issues or any other event related to complex systems. From time to time I will also announce compendiums or books that have been recently published, the latter with the intention of sharing different perspectives but being agnostic to their content. ***Complexity Cat*** will always look for healthy discussions on current topics that can be seen as controversial, debatable and questionable.
<br/><br/><br/>
- #### **Community**
This column has two purposes. The first is that young researchers can use ***Complexity Cat*** as a reference for job searches. Here we will publicize open positions as associate professor/lecturer, postdoctoral researcher opportunities, as well as doctoral and master's degree programs, all focused on complex systems or multidisciplinary science in general. The second goal of this column is to be a networking medium for young researchers. If you are looking for new collaborators, or just to let people know about your work, you can send us a short piece telling us about your background, skills and interests. We will take care of publishing this information and spreading the word on our Twitter/X account (@amahury0). In the near future I would also like to use this section to publish Q&As with researchers with a well established career. The idea is to use such interviews at the same time to disseminate their lines of research and inspire researchers who are just starting out.

- #### **Fiction**
  
Complexity Cat is an initiative created and promoted by Amahury J. Lopez-Diaz, a mexican physicist who wanted to develop a communication channel where young researchers keen on complex systems (and other similar interdisciplinary fields) could be kept posted about the most recent news related to it. This project started as a simple Twitter/X account (@amahury0) which later evolved to the present webpage.
