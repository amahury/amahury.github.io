### Empire AI Fellows Program 
This program is made possible by a gift from the Secunda Family Foundation to fund artificial intelligence-related research at Cornell Tech in New York City and at the Cornell Ann S. Bowers College of Computing and Information Science in Ithaca, amplifying their investment in the shared compute resources provided by the EmpireAI program. The program aims to support AI researchers in their pursuit of new, groundbreaking AI developments. By giving these researchers the freedom to explore all the opportunities that this nascent technology has to offer, the fellows program will open up a new world of technological development. This program is in partnership with the Jacobs Institute at Cornell Tech. 

### Foundational AI Fellows Program 
This program is made possible by a gift of Josh Kulkin to fund foundational research in artificial intelligence at the Cornell Ann S. Bowers College of Computing and Information Science in Ithaca and at Cornell Tech in New York City. The goal of the program is to support groundbreaking research to develop the foundations of artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing and related fields. Fellows will have the opportunity to participate in the thriving community of leading AI scholars in both locations.
