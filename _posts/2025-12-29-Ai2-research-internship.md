### Who You Are
Ai2 is seeking passionate, early-career researchers to join us for an internship. Undergraduate, Masters and PhD graduate students in AI-related fields are invited to apply for full-time research internships with us year-round. Applicants should have an interest in computer vision, natural language processing, machine learning, robotics, agents, and/or embodied AI. International candidates are welcome to apply. Pay is competitive, and visa sponsorship is available.

### Ai2 Research Internship Information
- Duration: 12 weeks
- Start date: Flexible
- Candidates: A PhD candidate or a master/undergraduate student with a strong research background.

​​Please apply by January 10, 2026 for Summer 2026. All applications made by January 10th, 2026 will be given full consideration, any applications received after this date will be considered on a rolling basis. Our initial round of interviews will be scheduled in January.

### Who We Are
Ai2’s Perceptual Reasoning and Interaction Research team (PRIOR) is looking for PhD students (and strong Masters and Undergraduate) interns to join our team. PRIOR seeks to advance computer vision to create AI systems that see, explore, learn, and reason about the world.

As a research intern in the PRIOR team, you will have the opportunity to work in a variety of research areas including:
- Language & Vision - Develop SOTA open source vision and language models. (Examples: Molmo, Molmo2, Unified IO2, One diffusion)
- Embodied AI / Robotics - Develop SOTA robot foundation models, to enable robots to navigate, manipulate objects, and follow instructions in simulation and in the real world (w/ real robot hardware). (Examples: MolmoAct, Spoc, Poliformer, ProcThor)
- Agents - Develop multimodal agents that automate real user tasks.
- AI for Common Good - Apply AI to help address global challenges such as climate change, illegal fishing, and wildlife poaching. (Examples: OlmoEarth, Satlas, Galileo)

### Your Next Challenge
At Ai2, you will be working with world-class AI researchers and talented software engineers. We perform team-based, ambitious research, with a mandate to strive for big breakthroughs, not just incremental progress, in an exciting and interactive workplace. 

All interns are paired with a mentor and will participate directly in Ai2's groundbreaking work. There are no restrictions on publications based on internships. Each of our research teams has a specific application for interested candidates, so please familiarize yourself with our projects and apply to the specific team(s) that best match your skills and interests.

Ai2 Research Interns will have the opportunity to do the following tasks:
- Reading the scientific literature to investigate and understand AI research.
- Executing AI research under guidance of the mentor, which may include building AI systems or system components, developing datasets, and/or conducting experiments.
- Meeting with the mentor to discuss research progress and ideas.
