### Job description
Many cities leverage Internet of Things sensors and analytics platforms to gather data on infrastructure, processes, and operations. This data is used to better manage resources, assets and services and improve operations. To fully support the digitization of cities the telecommunications networks also need to evolve, offering e.g., ubiquitous connectivity and decentralised datacenter capabilities to optimize urban performance. This project aims to explore how telecommunications networks both influence and are influenced by urban systems, and to identify network designs that can further enhance global telecom and urban performance.

This exciting PhD project presents several scientific challenges, including: developing advanced models for co-evolution driven by real-world data, surpassing state-of-the-art synthetic models; collecting and integrating diverse datasets, including entity matching; and combining expertise from network data science, telecommunications, and urban studies to address aforementioned modeling and design questions.

You will be part of a leading team in network data science within the Multimedia Computing Group (MMC) in Computer Science. We share a drive to understand and optimize complex systems ranging from social, technical to economic systems.

The supervision team consists of Dr. Huijuan Wang from MMC and Dr. Eric Smeitink from KPN and Network Architectures and Services Group.

The PhD position is part of NExTWORKx*, the strategic partnership between the Telecom and ICT service provider KPN and Delft University of Technology. Curious to learn more about the project? Feel free to visit our website, where you’ll also find other exciting PhD opportunities related to this collaboration.

In your role, you will collaborate with NExTWORKx partners and external collaborators, such as those from Statistics Netherlands and experts in urban and regional studies. Fostering an inspiring, friendly and supportive environment, we meet regularly, and share ideas and knowledge. And you will receive all the training you need to evolve as a scientist.   

### Requirements
In order to be successful, you will have:
- MSc in Computer Science, Physics, Engineering, mathematics or related disciplines with a strong background in data analysis, mathematical modeling and algorithms
- Good programming skills in Python/C/C++
- Good oral and written skills in English
- Enjoys working in an international and inter-disciplinary research group

Because of project definitions, we are looking for EU citizens.

### Conditions of employment 
Doctoral candidates will be offered a 4-year period of employment in principle, but in the form of 2 employment contracts. An initial 1,5 year contract with an official go/no go progress assessment within 15 months. Followed by an additional contract for the remaining 2,5 years assuming everything goes well and performance requirements are met. 

Salary and benefits are in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities, increasing from € 2872 per month in the first year to € 3670 in the fourth year. As a PhD candidate you will be enrolled in the TU Delft Graduate School. The TU Delft Graduate School provides an inspiring research environment with an excellent team of supervisors, academic staff and a mentor. The Doctoral Education Programme is aimed at developing your transferable, discipline-related and research skills. 

The TU Delft offers a customisable compensation package, discounts on health insurance, and a monthly work costs contribution. Flexible work schedules can be arranged.  

For international applicants, TU Delft has the Coming to Delft Service. This service provides information for new international employees to help you prepare the relocation and to settle in the Netherlands. The Coming to Delft Service offers a Dual Career Programme for partners and they organise events to expand your (social) network.
