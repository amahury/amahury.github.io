### About The Event
The CS2 Italy Conference is the premier venue for computational social scientists in Italy and it aims to become an important event for the international research community. The event will serve as a platform for researchers from different disciplines, including economics, sociology, political science, psychology, cognitive science, computer science, and the full range of natural and applied sciences, to explore the intersection of social phenomena and computational methods. With a focus on leveraging cutting-edge technologies to analyze, model, and understand human behavior, the conference promises insightful discussions, groundbreaking research presentations, and networking opportunities.

### Topics
We welcome submissions on any topic in the field of computational social science, including but not limited to:
- Theoretical work that generates new insights, connections, and frameworks for computational social science research
- Data-driven work that describes and discovers social and cultural phenomena or explains and estimates relations between them and the larger society
- Work that advances methods and approaches for computational social science

The accepted contributions will be selected for one of the following presentations:
- a lightning talk (~6 mins) in a plenary session
- an oral presentation in parallel tracks

### Abstract Submission
- Abstract submission: January 15, 2026
- Notification of abstract acceptance: March 1, 2026
- Early-bird registration deadline: April 15, 2026
- Registrations close: May 14, 2026
- Conference days: May 19-21, 2026

Submissions are in the form of extended abstracts (max 2 pages) written in English, in PDF format, formatted according to the official LaTex or MS Word template.

The submission should include a title, author names and affiliations, and an extended abstract (serving as the main text of the submission). The abstract should outline the impact of the work, along with (if relevant) the main theoretical contribution, data and methods used, and findings. Authors are strongly encouraged to include figures and/or tables in their submission (note that figures and/or tables, and references will not count towards the page limit). Submitted abstracts will undergo a single-blind review process. Follow the submission link below to submit your abstract.

Submissions will be non-archival, and thus the presented work can be already published, in preparation for publication elsewhere, or ongoing research. Abstracts will be reviewed by multiple members of a Program Committee composed of experts in computational social science. The accepted contributions will be selected for one of the following presentations: a lightning talk (~6 mins) in a plenary session, or an oral presentation in parallel tracks (~15 mins). Lightning talks will be preferentially assigned to those requesting this form of presentation at submission and to early career researchers. In order to be included in the program, at least one of the authors must register for the conference by the early-bird registration deadline.
