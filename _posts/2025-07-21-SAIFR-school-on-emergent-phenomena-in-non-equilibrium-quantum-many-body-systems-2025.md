### About
This two-week school is aimed at Master’s and PhD students interested in the dynamics of quantum many-body systems, with a focus on both foundational concepts and modern theoretical tools. The program will begin with an introduction to many-body statistical mechanics and the equilibrium physics of systems with short- and long-range interactions, setting the stage for an in-depth exploration of non-equilibrium dynamics, thermalization, and ergodicity. The school will provide a hands-on overview of key analytical approaches, including field-theoretical techniques, semiclassical methods, and the physics of disordered systems, including many-body localization, emergent integrability, and driven-dissipative systems. Our program covers also a quick introduction to modern experimental platforms where quantum many body dynamics is nowadays routinely explored, encompassing cavity QED and trapped ions experiments.

A highlight of the program will be two special guest lectures by Subir Sachdev (Harvard University), offering insights into quantum criticality and emergent phenomena in strongly correlated systems. Lectures will be complemented by interactive discussions and problem sessions, creating an environment that fosters both learning and collaboration.

You can find information on the previous School on Emergent Phenomena in Non-Equilibrium Quantum Many-Body Systems here and the Minicourse on open quantum systems: fundamentals, collisional models, and path integrals here.

_There is no registration fee and limited funds are available for travel and local expenses._

Application deadline: August 03, 2025.

### Additional info
Attention! Some participants in ICTP-SAIFR activities have received email from fake travel agencies asking for credit card information. All communication with participants will be made by ICTP-SAIFR staff using an e-mail “@ictp-saifr.org”. We will not send any mailings about accommodation that require a credit card number or any sort of deposit. Also, if you are staying at Hotel Intercity the Universe Paulista, please confirm with the Uber/Taxi driver that the hotel is located at Rua Pamplona 83 in Bela Vista (and not in Jardim Etelvina).

BOARDING PASS: All participants, whose travel has been provided or will be reimbursed by ICTP-SAIFR, should bring the boarding pass  upon registration. The return boarding pass (PDF, if online check-in, scan or picture, if physical) should be sent to secretary@ictp-saifr.org by e-mail.

Visa information: Nationals from several countries in Latin America and Europe are exempt from tourist visa. Nationals from Australia, Canada and USA will be required to obtain a tourist e-visa for visits after April 10, 2025. Please check here which nationals need a tourist visa to enter Brazil.

Accommodation: Participants whose accommodations are provided by ICTP-SAIFR will stay at Hotel Intercity the Universe Paulista. Other hotel recommendations are available here.

Poster presentation: Participants who are presenting a poster MUST BRING A PRINTED BANNER. The banner size should be at most 1 m (width) x 1,5 m (length). We do not accept A4 or A3 paper.
