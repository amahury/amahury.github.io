### Aims and Topics
The CoBrain satellite workshop aims to bring together researchers from neuroscience, complex systems, and related fields to explore complexity in brain dynamics, structure, and function. This one-day event will feature four keynote presentations and contributed talks discussing cutting-edge methods and theories for understanding the intricate complexity of the brain across multiple scales.

Key topics include:
- Complex network models of brain connectivity
- Information theory applied to neural systems
- Emergent dynamics in neural populations
- Multi-scale approaches to brain complexity
- Computational neuroscience and complex systems

### Registration and Access
The workshop will be held as a part of the CCS*2025 in Siena, Italy. Please see the CCS 2025 website for registration to the satellites (this is required to attend).

Note: Registration for CCS 2025 provides access to all satellite events, including CoBrain 2025.

### Call for Contributed Talks
The call for contributions is now open!

We welcome contributions from a wide range of areas within the study of complexity in the brain and computational neuroscience. Each submission received by the Microsoft CMT submission system will be assessed by members of the Program Committee with expertise in the research area. Acceptance will be notified to the corresponding author through CMT.

Submission Deadline: May 5th

Notification of Acceptance: May 30th

#### How to submit:
Upload requirements. Please prepare a PDF document of 2 pages maximum. In the first page, you must include title, authors and their affiliations, and full abstract of your talk. The second page can only include one figure with caption, and references. If you are using LaTeX, please download the template linked here. If you are using another editor like Word, please convert to PDF before submission. Please indicate your preference for a contributed talk or poster. Note that this preference may not be guaranteed. Ensure uploads are not password protected and are no larger than 5MB in size. The co-authors must be added only in the PDF. Only the corresponding author will need to insert the information on the Microsoft CMT system.

### Instructions for the Authors
Accepted abstracts must be presented by one registered author. This presentation must be in-person. If no author is registered before the deadline, the contribution will be withdrawn from the programme. An author cannot present more than one accepted talk or poster.

#### Before Submission:
To make the submission process smooth for you, please have the following ready when making the upload to the submission portal: presenting author's full name, affiliation, email, and contact number (where you can be reached during the conference). Co-authors' full names, affiliations, and email addresses. A PDF of the abstract. In the Microsoft CMT form, also insert a short 2000-character summary of your abstract and submit it together with the abstract PDF. Once an initial submission is made, it can be edited any time before the submission deadline. For more information, email ccsneuro@gmail.com.

#### Presentation Guidelines
- Oral Presentations: Accepted talks will be allocated a 15-minute slot, consisting of 12 minutes for the presentation and 3 minutes for audience questions.
- Poster Presentations: Accepted posters will be featured in dedicated poster sessions. All posters should be self-printed in A0 format (84.1 cm Ã— 118.9 cm, portrait orientation).
