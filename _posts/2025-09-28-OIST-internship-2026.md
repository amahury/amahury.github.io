### Eligibility
Those who are currently enrolled in their last two years of a bachelor's degree, enrolled in any year of a master's degree in universities, colleges, junior colleges, and vocational schools in Japan or overseas, or those who have graduated with a bachelor's or master's degree, are eligible to apply for the Research Internship at OIST.

Currently enrolled students must have approval from their home institution. The academic background of applicants should be appropriate to their desired host unit(s) at OIST.

Our Research Internship is intended for those who need more research experience and who are interested in joining OIST's PhD Program later. Current or graduated PhD students who wish to collaborate with OIST should look for other opportunities such as Workshops or Careers at OIST.

Research Interns who belong to a Japanese university/institution are required to prepare and bring their own insurances when accepted to the OIST Research Internship Program. Acceptable insurances are the combination of Gakkensai and Gakkenbai, or other insurances with similar coverage.

### Application Procedure
We only accept application documents online. To apply for the program, you must create an account.
Please prepare all required documents in English, save them as a PDF file, and upload them to the application website. You can complete the application in one session or save your progress and return to finish it later.

The Spring 2026 Internship is now open. Please visit the application website for more details.

Note: We recommend using a computer when preparing the online application. If you prefer using a mobile device, please make sure to have the latest operating system for the application website to work properly.

### Application Documents
Transcript and Diploma: Scanned copies of your current academic transcript and any other transcript from your past degree (BSc, MSc, etc.) along with completed diploma (BSc, MSc, etc.) in PDF format.
- A scan of an unofficial transcript or other record of grades may be uploaded to the application website.
- English explanation is required for transcripts that are not written in English.
- If you have not graduated and do not have a diploma yet, please upload a certificate of enrollment from your institution, preferably indicating your expected graduation date.

Statement of Purpose: This should be no more than 400 words (2500 characters) and should address the following points:
- How does OIST and your desired research unit(s) fit with your current expertise and skill set? If you are interested in multiple research units, please explain your interest and fit for each unit briefly within one single statement.
- What do you hope to accomplish at OIST?
- How does a research internship at OIST fit into your overall career plans/aspirations?

Recommendation Letter: Each applicant is required to have at least one and no more than three letters of recommendation from professorial-level faculty who knows you and your work personally. Letters from lab members or postdoctoral researchers are not eligible. If you include recommendations from industry experience, they must be from a manager who has supervised you.

Please ensure you obtain permission and confirm that you have the correct email address before entering contact information. Your recommender will receive an automatic message from OIST requesting them to submit a recommendation letter. Recommenders must follow the instructions provided in the email. OIST does not accept recommendation letters submitted directly by applicants.

Please be considerate of your recommenders and ensure they have ample time to submit their recommendation letters before the application deadline. OIST does not grant any deadline extensions.

OIST declines to disclose any submitted recommendation letters. To ensure the objectivity of the evaluation, recommendation letters will remain confidential, and applicants will not be permitted to view the letters submitted.

You can only submit your application after at least one recommendation letter is received in the application system.

Passport: The application system requires applicants to provide their passport number and upload a scan of the passport photo page. It is essential for applicants from outside Japan to have a valid passport for travel to Japan. Ensure that you include your passport details during the application process.

If you do not have a passport at the time of application, you can upload other government-issued identification documents instead. However, if you are selected for the program, OIST will need a copy of your valid passport immediately to prepare your visa application and travel arrangement.

ID Photo: Please upload a recent photo taken within the last three months, showing your face from the front in standard passport orientation.

English Proficiency Score (optional): An English Proficiency Score (iELTS/TOEFL) is not required for the Research Internship application. However, you may upload it if you believe it to strengthen your application.

### Application Fee
The application fee for the Research Internship Program is 3,000 JPY. It is not refundable on any circumstances, nor are fee waivers offered for personal financial situations at this time.
