### About Us
The Society for Experimental Biology (SEB) is a learned society that was established in 1923 at Birkbeck College in London to "promote the art and science of experimental biology in all its branches".

Today we represent and bring together an international community of experimental biologists to support them in their scientific work, new ideas and experimental techniques, and establish connections between cell, plant, and animal biology as covered by our three sections.

One of our key aims is to increase the influence of experimental biology within the scientific community and demonstrate to the wider public its importance and the impact of biological research on tackling real-world issues such as climate change, food security and conservation efforts.
