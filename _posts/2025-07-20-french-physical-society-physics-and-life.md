### Description
The conference will cover a wide range of topics at the interface between physics and biology, from the molecular to the population scale, experimental, computational and theoretical work. The aim is to bring together a diverse community of researchers working in French laboratories to strengthen collaborations in this vast field.

To stimulate exchange and learning on a variety of topics, four researchers were invited to give an introductory talk on their area of interest and a classic presentation of their latest findings:
- Laura Cantini (CNRS, Institut Pasteur) - Integrative genomics
- Pauline Durand-Smet (Lab. MSC, CNRS, Univ. Paris-Cité) - Plant biomechanics
- Sylvie Lorthois (IMFT, CNRS, Univ. de Toulouse) - Cerebral microcirculation
- François Peaudecerf (IPR, CNRS, Univ. de Rennes) - Soil bacteria soft matter

A fifth guest speaker will be announced this summer. We'll have around 15 selected talks and a poster session, both of which are open to both junior and senior researchers.

Please note that the meeting will start on Thursday around 2 p.m. and finish on Friday around 4 p.m. to allow non-parisians to travel easily. Thursday dinner, Friday lunch and coffee breaks are included.

Abstract submission and registration are open until September 5.
