We are happy to announce that the next conference on “Criticality in Neural Systems 2024: Collective Behavior, Synchronization, and Complexity” will take place at the Natcher Conference Center (National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) from Nov. 6 – 8th, 2024. 

Keeping line with previous editions of the Brain Criticality conferences series, this conference will present the latest experimental and theoretical advancements in the study of critical phenomena in brain activity and their functional relevance. While preserving emphasis on criticality, this edition will feature as well communications about general collective behavior and dynamic complexity in the brain (and other biological systems).

The conference will be held in a hybrid format, both in presence at NIH Bethesda (more about the venue here) and via Zoom. Presentations by the invited speakers, with ample time for discussions, including with online participants, are complemented by a poster session (in presence and online) and by a selection of contributed spotlight presentations.

A few spotlight presenters, selected among submitted abstract contributor will be given the opportunity of short presentations. Other abstracts will be presented as posters in “hybrid poster sessions” (virtual poster and, in addition, printed poster if attending in presence).
