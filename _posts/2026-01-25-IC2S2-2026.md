### About
The International Conference for Computational Social Science (IC2S2) will be hosted by the Vermont Complex Systems Institute at the University of Vermont in Burlington, Vermont from July 28-31, 2026. IC2S2 has emerged as the dominant conference at the intersection of social and computational science, bringing together researchers from around the world in sociology, economics, political science, psychology, cognitive science, management, computer science, statistics and the full range of natural and applied sciences committed to understanding the social world through large-scale data and computation. IC2S2 is the annual conference of the International Society for Computational Social Science.

The full-scale three-day conference (July 29-31) will feature research and researchers from around the world, across a broad range of relevant fields, and working on all areas of computational social science to advance its many frontiers. July 28 will be reserved for workshops and tutorials particularly targeted at early-career scholars.

The IC2S2 community actively balances and maintains a conversation between social and computational scientists which integrates technological advances and opportunities with social scientific rigor and insight.

### Topics
We welcome submissions on any topic in the field of computational social science, including
- work that advances methods and approaches for computational social science,
- data-driven work that describes and discovers social and cultural phenomena or explains and estimates relations between them and other things,
- theoretical work that generates new insights, connections and frameworks for computational social science research.

Researchers across disciplines, faculty, graduate students, industry researchers, policy makers, and nonprofit workers are all encouraged to submit computational data- driven research and innovative computational methodological or theoretical contributions on social phenomena for consideration. Topics include but are not limited to:
- Network analysis of social systems
- Large-scale social experiments
- Empirically calibrated simulation models
- Large language models for social research
- Text analysis and natural language processing (NLP) of social phenomena
- Analysis of meaning through computational analysis of text, images, audio, video, etc.
- Computational methods to map and study cultural patterns and dynamics
- Agent-based or other simulation of social phenomena
- Methods and issues of social data collection
- Images as social data
- Causal inference and machine learning
- Methods and analyses of biased, selective, or incomplete observational social data
- Integration and triangulation of multi-modal social and cultural data
- Methods and analyses for social information / digital communication dynamics
- Neural network methods for social analysis and policy exploration
- Reproducibility in computational social science research
- Theoretical discussions/concepts in computational social science
- Ethics of computational research on human behavior
- Issues of inclusivity in computational social science
- Methods and analyses of algorithmic accountability and trustworthiness
- Novel digital data and/or computational analyses for addressing societal challenges
- Social news curation and collaborative filtering
- Building and evaluating socio-technical systems
- Methods and analyses of integrated human-machine decision-making
- Science and technology studies approaches to computational science work
- Infrastructure to facilitate industry/academic cooperation in computational social science
- Computational social science research in industry, government, and philanthropy
- Practical problems in computational social science

### Call For Tutorials
The International Conference on Computational Social Science (IC2S2) is the premier conference bringing together researchers from different disciplines interested in using computational and data-intensive methods to solve problems relevant to society. IC2S2 hosts academics and practitioners in computational science, complexity, network science, and social science, and provides a platform for new research in the field of computational social science.
- Tutorial proposal submission deadline: February 2, 2026
- Notification of tutorial acceptance: February 16, 2026
- Tutorial day: July 28, 2026

Submissions for Tutorial proposals should be formatted according to the official LaTeX or MS Word template and should be no more than three pages in length. The submission file must be submitted in PDF format and should be no larger than 20MB. Proposals should contain the following:
- Title
- Presenters / organizers: Please provide names, affiliations, email addresses, and short bios (up to 200 words) for each presenter. Bios should cover the presenters' expertise related to the topic of the tutorial. If there are multiple presenters, please describe how the time will be divided between them.
- Topic: An abstract describing the topic (up to 300 words)
- Rationale: What is the objective / learning outcome of the tutorial? What is the benefit for the attendees? Why is this tutorial important to the IC2S2 community?
- Format: A description of the proposed event format and a list of proposed activities, with a description of the hands-on component (tools, packages, methods etc). We encourage organizers to specify any technique that they can offer to broaden the accessibility of the content (e.g., closed captioning of slides).
- Equipment: A short note on equipment or features required for the tutorial.
- Audience: A short statement about the expected target audience. What prior knowledge, if any, do you expect from the audience?
- Proposed length: please choose from 3 hours (full session) or 6 hours (full day). If you are flexible, please indicate in the outline which parts will be included in the short/long versions.
- Preferred time slot: Please indicate your preference for the morning slot (from 9.15am) or the afternoon slot (from 1:45pm)
- Number of participants: Please specify the maximum number of participants that could reasonably attend and be instructed by the organizers.
- Previous tutorials: Has the tutorial been presented previously? If so, specify the previous venues and years in which the event was held, and provide either a short description or a link to the websites of the previous editions.

The aim with tutorials is that participants can take home knowledge and skills on methods that they can apply to their own research. Priority will be given to tutorials that include hands-on and active learning components. Tutorials should be comprehensive and should not focus only on the presenter’s previous work. We also welcome proposals for tutorials on "disciplinary state of the art sessions" that give a focused overview on the latest developments, trends and perspectives in a specific discipline or research area and any other topics at the intersection of the social sciences, computer science and/or statistics. Tutorials should be of interest to a substantial portion of the community and should represent a sufficiently mature area of research or practice. A regular tutorial slot is 3 hours long. However, we are also accepting proposals for full-day tutorials (6 hours). The full conference registration fee will be waived for one organizer per tutorial.
