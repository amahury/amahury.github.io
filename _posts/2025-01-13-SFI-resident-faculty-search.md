The Santa Fe Institute (SFI) seeks applications for full-time, 12-month resident faculty positions at all academic levels. 

SFI is an independent research center dedicated to investigating fundamental scientific questions related to complex systems. We seek researchers from any scientific field who use rigorous, quantitative and/or computational approaches to address big questions that transcend traditional disciplinary boundaries, and whose research will complement and expand ongoing research activities at SFI.

The Institute, based in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA, serves as a research hub populated by 20-50 researchers in residence, including faculty, postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and visitors. Resident and visiting researchers are closely integrated with a large international network of over one hundred actively involved external faculty and many other researchers, artists, writers, and industry affiliates. You can find more information about SFI here: https://www.santafe.edu/.

We seek applicants who have outstanding academic accomplishments in their own field, who engage other disciplines in deep ways, who are broad thinkers as well as creative, catalytic, and risk-taking, who are great communicators and enjoy collaboration, and who are looking to break new ground in addressing some of science and societyâ€™s most challenging problems.

Applicants must have a Ph.D. with a strong record of excellence both in depth and breadth. SFI welcomes applicants from any country. Successful foreign applicants must acquire an acceptable visa as a condition of employment. The Santa Fe Institute is an equal opportunity employer. Women and members of underrepresented groups are especially encouraged to apply.

### Position details
Resident faculty at SFI hold 12-month, in-person positions for 5-year terms, with the possibility of renewals. SFI does not have laboratory space, although faculty are welcome to collaborate with researchers at other institutions with such facilities. Positions involve no formal teaching and come with funds for travel, visitors, meetings, and non-laboratory equipment. Participation in Institute activities such as proposal development, postdoc mentoring, education programs, and applied complexity network outreach is expected. SFI offers competitive salaries and benefits. 

### Application requirements
The closing date for this call is Friday, March 28, 2025.

**Only complete applications will be considered.  The following materials are required:**
- A statement of research interests and directions that the applicant would hope to pursue at SFI. This statement should mention any association with SFI through collaborations, talks, and meetings including workshops, working groups, or symposia.
- A complete curriculum vitae.
- The names of, and contact information for, four recommenders.
- PDF copies of three papers, chapters, or monographs that best illustrate the applicant's suitability for a resident faculty position at SFI.
