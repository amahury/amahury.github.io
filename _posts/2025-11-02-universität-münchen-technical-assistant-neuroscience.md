### General Info
- Position: Technician
- Deadline: 15 November 2025
- Employment Start Date: 1 January 2026
- Contract Length: 2 years (with the possibility of extension)
- City: Munich
- Country: Germany
- Institution: Ludwig Maximilian University (LMU) of Munich
- Department: Neurobiology

### Description of the Schroeder Lab
The newly established group of Prof. Dr. Anna Schroeder at LMU Munich is seeking an excellent candidate for a technical assistant (full-time) position in neuroscience. The position is initially offered on a 2-year fixed-term basis with the possibility of extension.

For more information, visit https://www.annaschroederlab.com

Our lab investigates the neural circuits underlying emotions, motivations, and physiological needs, focusing on how these internal states shape behavior in dynamic environments. Specifically, we study the subthalamic circuits of the zona incerta, an enigmatic brain region that integrates internal states, external sensory cues, and past experiences to adapt behavior flexibly. To dissect the neural circuit mechanisms driving behavior, we employ cutting-edge methodologies including:
- In vivo calcium imaging with 2-photon microscopy or Miniscopes
- Whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology
- Single-cell RNA sequencing
- Optogenetics
- Chemogenetics
- Viral circuit tracing
- State-driven behavioral paradigms
- Transgenic mouse models
- Advanced machine learning techniques

Our ultimate goal is to advance understanding of brain function and develop novel therapeutic strategies for psychiatric disorders through neuromodulation. Prof. Dr. Schroeder is deeply committed to training, mentorship and career development for lab members. The lab offers state-of-the-art neuroscience in a very supportive environment.

### Your tasks and responsibilities
Participation in the preparation and implementation of research and teaching, as well as the organization of laboratory processes:
- Conduct DNA/RNA sequencing and genotyping
- Manage and plan mouse colonies
- Perform histology, immunostaining and microscopic data analysis
- Plan, order and maintain lab equipment and supplies; train new users
- Prepare solutions and handle general lab upkeep (waste, autoclaving, glassware)
- Manage documentation (genetic engineering, virus/S1, work safety, invoices)
- Support student internships and ongoing research projects
- Help foster an inclusive, hardworking and supportive lab environment

### Eligibility requirements 
Candidates must meet the following criteria:
- Completed vocational training and state recognition as a Biological Technical Assistant (BTA) or a completed Bachelor of Science or equivalent
- Proficiency in written and spoken English
- Ability to work independently and structure workflows effectively
- Strong motivation, attention to detail, and a positive, proactive attitude
- Organizational skills, reliability and diligence
- Willingness to engage in continuous professional development
- Enjoyment of working in an international, research-based environment
- Effective communication and teamwork skills

Beneficial qualifications:
- Experience in managing mouse lines, DNA/RNA sequencing and histology
- Proficiency in written and spoken German
- Knowledge of neurobiology and cell biology

### What we offer
Our lab is located at the LMU Biocenter on the high-tech campus in Martinsried. We offer an interesting and responsible position with excellent training and development opportunities:
- LMU Munich is often ranked as the best university in Germany and is consistently ranked among the top 50 universities worldwide, both overall and for life sciences specifically
- According to the Nature Index, LMU Munich is the top academic institution in Germany for neuroscience
- Advanced neuroscience research with cutting-edge tools in state-of-the-art facilities
- Collaborative and inclusive environment, including partnerships with leading local institutions (e.g., Max Planck Institutes, DZNE, Helmholtz Institutes, TU Munich) all connected via the Munich Center for Neurosciences
- Mentorship and career development support from Prof. Dr. Schroeder, a young and highly motivated PI who is genuinely invested in the success of her team members
- Opportunity to live in Munich, a vibrant, international city near lakes and mountains with one of the world’s strongest neuroscience communities and a very high quality of life
- Remuneration according to the collective agreement for the public service of the federal states (TV-L) in E9
- Various LMU corporate benefits

### How to apply
Applications must provide the following and can be sent to Prof. Dr. Schroeder by email at anna.schroeder@bio.lmu.de (one PDF file, maximum 5 MB):
- Cover letter detailing prior training and/or research experience and why you’d like to join the Schroeder lab
- CV
- Names and contact details for 1-2 referee

The application deadline is November 15, 2025. The position can start as soon as possible.
