### About the conference
The International Conference for Computational Social Science (IC2S2) will be hosted by the Swedish Excellence Center for Computational Social Science and the Institute for Analytical Sociology (IAS), Norrköping, Sweden, on July 22-24, 2025. IC2S2 has emerged as the dominant conference at the intersection of social and computational science, bringing together researchers from around the world in sociology, economics, political science, psychology, cognitive science, management, computer science, statistics and the full range of natural and applied sciences committed to understanding the social world through large-scale data and computation. IC2S2 is the annual conference of the International Society for Computational Social Science.

The full-scale three-day conference (July 22-24) will feature research and researchers from around the world, across a broad range of relevant fields, and working on all areas of computational social science to advance its many frontiers. July 21 will be reserved for workshops and tutorials particularly targeted at early-career scholars.

The IC2S2 community actively balances and maintains a conversation between social and computational scientists which integrates technological advances and opportunities with social scientific rigor and insight.
