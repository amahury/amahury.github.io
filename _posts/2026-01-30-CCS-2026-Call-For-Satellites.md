### About CCS 2026
The 2026 Conference on Complex Systems will be held in Binghamton, New York, USA. Binghamton has a long history of creativity and innovation. The Greater Binghamton area has historically been called "the Valley of Opportunity" and attracted many immigrants (especially from Europe) since the mid-1800s, which has made the region's rich and diverse culture and demographics. It is the birthplace of IBM (International Business Machines), Link Flight Simulator, McIntosh Laboratory, and a number of other pioneering ventures, fostering a spirit of ingenuity that continues to thrive.

Located at the confluence of the Susquehanna river (one of the oldest rivers in the world) and the Chenango river, the region boasts stunning natural beauty and offers ample opportunities for outdoor recreation, from hiking and biking to fishing and kayaking. In particular, in mid-October when CCS 2026 is held, the Binghamton area will showcase its renowned and breathtaking fall foliage. Furthermore, a vibrant arts and culture scene flourishes here, with numerous galleries, theaters, and music venues providing enriching experiences.

CCS 2026 will be held primarily in person on the main campus at Binghamton University, with an online participation option via Zoom.

### Call For Satellites
We invite proposals of satellite sessions that will be held on Wednesday and Thursday at CCS 2026. Satellites can be a full-day or half-day session on a specific topic relevant to complex systems. Successful satellite session proposers will be expected to independently organize and manage their session through their own committees. Satellite organizers will be responsible for soliciting and reviewing contributions, coordinating with presenters, and maintaining the satellite’s webpage. Coffee breaks and lunch will be provided by the CCS 2026 main conference organizers.

Organizers of an accepted satellite will be given a satellite-only one-day registration fee waiver for one person, which can be used to cover the registration of an invited speaker, an organizer, or any other designated participant. All the satellites will be promoted on the CCS 2026 website and social media, and all the satellite’s invited speakers will also be featured there as well.
