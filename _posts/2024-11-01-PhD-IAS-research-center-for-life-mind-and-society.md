We’re thrilled to invite motivated researchers from around the world to apply for a unique PhD studentship at the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), based in the IAS-Research Center for Life, Mind, and Society. This studentship is part of the research project “Outagencies: Varieties of autonomous agency across living, humanimal, and technical systems” (PID2023-147251NB-I00 lead by Xabier Barandiaran), where we explore the concept of “agency” across a range of disciplines—from philosophy to artificial intelligence, and from evolutionary biology to social sciences.

**Deadline**: November 18th, 2024

**Salary**: €19,500-€25,000 annually during 4 years (salary increases every year)

**Duration**: 4 years starting early 2025

### A Bit About Us and the Outagencies Project
Our centre [https://ias-research.net], located in the vibrant city of San Sebastián on the Basque coast, fosters a dynamic, interdisciplinary environment where more than 20 researchers from diverse backgrounds are investigating the philosophical, theoretical, and complex systems aspects of life, mind, and society. Our project [https://outonomy.net/project-description/], with its naturalistic and transdisciplinary approach, is an exciting inquiry into autonomous agency, aiming to bridge gaps across disciplines and uncover how agency manifests and interacts with materiality, technology, and living systems. It’s a great opportunity to join us if you’re interested in philosophical reflection that connects deeply with scientific and technological developments.

### What We’re Looking For
We’re seeking candidates who are excited about our research focus and interested in contributing to the project’s work packages: from studying protocell organization and ecological contexts in “Living Matters,” to studying transitions along the animal-human continuum in “Humanimal Varieties”, to analyzing AI’s impact on human agency in “Artificial Agencies,” to integrating findings across philosophical perspectives in “Acts of Integration”. You can learn more about the project here:
https://outonomy.net/project-description/

Beyond formal requirements, we highly value applicants with a strong motivation for this project. We’ll assess candidates based on:
- Your motivation letter, where we’d love to hear why this project resonates with you and which areas of our research you’re most passionate about.
- The quality of an academic work sample (such as your Master’s thesis, class paper, or article).
- Your language proficiency in English (certification required).
- Other languages and your disciplinary background, especially if it aligns with the project focus.

While the administrative side of the application process is important, we encourage you to think of this as the beginning of a collaborative journey. We are excited to meet enthusiastic individuals who wish to dive into a challenging academic environment with like-minded peers.

### Key Details & How to Apply
The successful candidate will begin work with us in early 2025 (before March), based on-site in San Sebastián, with an annual gross salary of €19,00-€26,000, non-negotiable, that increases every year.

If you want to apply, you will have to follow two parallel procedures:
1. Preliminary academic evaluation and submission process (mandatory before November 18th, 2024): Initial Application Form [https://forms.gle/AGAHu6osrSUJ4Bxd9]
2. Formal administrative application (required alongside the above) will be published here: Official Call [https://www.ehu.eus/es/web/ikerketaren-kudeaketa/-/fpi-2024_upv_ehu]

We understand this implies a double effort, but we believe this first step allows us to connect with you directly and evaluate your academic profile with care and understanding. 

Any queries about requirements, formal procedure and contracting-related questions, access, visas, or any other technical consultation should be addressed to  pre-postdoc.dgi@ehu.eus AND rhh-inves.dgi@ehu.eus or by calling +34 943017865 where you can be assisted in English (as well as Spanish or Basque).

We look forward to receiving your application and hopefully welcoming you soon to the IAS-Research Center, where we’ll be delving together into some of the most fascinating philosophical questions of our times!
