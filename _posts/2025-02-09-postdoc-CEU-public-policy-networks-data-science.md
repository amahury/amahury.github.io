### Duties and Responsibilities 
Building on EU’s definition of rule of law, NET-ROL analyzes networks in law-making, executive decision-making and the judiciary. Using state-of-the-art data techniques such as causal machine learning and multi-layer network analysis, the project generates original knowledge on causes of rule of law weakening and the impact on socio-economic outcomes such as growth, inequality, and trust. Within this framework, the postdoc will work on legislative and regulatory network analysis. 

### Qualifications
PhD in data science, network science, computational social science or related fields. Solid knowledge in network science, programming in Python or R, and experience in data wrangling as well as good academic writing, communication, and presentation skills in English are required; knowledge of text mining techniques is a plus. Strong interest in interdisciplinary research, in particular on corruption, favoritism, rule of law is expected. There are no teaching obligations but opportunities.

### What CEU Offers 
We offer competitive remuneration of 56,000 EUR/year (gross). 

The postdoctoral researcher will work in a dynamic, truly international environment as a member of one of Europe’s leading centers in network science and corruption research within a large international project providing opportunities for further scientific interactions. The investigated topics are at the forefront of computational social science giving the young researcher a solid basis for her/his further career. Vienna has been for years at the top in the list of most livable cities in the World.

### How to Apply
Submit a CV, motivation letter and a writing sample best demonstrating suitability to the job.

Review of applications starts February 22, 2025 and continues until the position is filled.

### About CEU
One of the world’s most international universities, a unique founding mission positions Central European University as both an acclaimed center for the study of economic, historical, social and political challenges, and a source of support for building open and democratic societies that respect human rights and human dignity. CEU is accredited in the United States and Austria, and offers English-language bachelor's, master's and doctoral programs in the social sciences, the humanities, law, environmental sciences, management and public policy. CEU enrolls more than 1,400 students from over 100 countries, with faculty from over 50 countries.

In 2019, CEU relocated from Hungary to Austria as the Hungarian government revoked its ability to issue US-accredited degrees in the country. As a result, CEU offers all of its degree programs in Vienna, Austria; and retains a non-degree, research and civic engagement presence in Budapest, Hungary, through its CEU Democracy Institute, the Institute for Advanced Study, the CEU Summer University and The Vera and Donald Blinken Open Society Archives (OSA), and its Hungarian language public educational programs and public lectures.
