The ICTP South American Institute for Fundamental Research (ICTP-SAIFR) announces the opening of two Simons-FAPESP tenure-track research professor positions to begin in 2026, with the first in connections of physics to biology and the second in all other areas related to theoretical physics. The international search committee includes William Bialek (Princeton), Olga Dudko (UC San Diego), Simon Levin (Princeton), Gabriel Mindlin (Buenos Aires) and José Nelson Onuchic (Rice) in areas related to biology, and Leticia Cugliandolo (Sorbonne), Scott Dodelson (Carnegie Mellon), Eduardo Fradkin (chair, Illinois at Urbana-Champaign), Michael Green (Cambridge) and David Gross (KITP) in all other areas.

ICTP-SAIFR is a South American center for theoretical physics created in 2011 as the first partner institute of the Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP). It is associated with the Instituto de Física Teórica (IFT-UNESP) in downtown São Paulo and has a large number of postdocs and visitors. In addition to performing research and organizing activities, the new professors will assist in the teaching and supervising of Master’s and PhD students of IFT-UNESP. Successful candidates will be highly considered for permanent tenured positions at ICTP-SAIFR/IFT-UNESP in 2026-2027, and ICTP-SAIFR plans to begin hosting KITP-like programs in the near future.

Salary includes generous fellowships from the Simons Foundation and the São Paulo Research Funding Agency (FAPESP), and additional grants are available for research/travel from state and national funding agencies. Researchers can also use ICTP-SAIFR funds for graduate students, postdocs and visitors, as well as participate in ICTP-SAIFR visitor agreements with ICTP Trieste, Perimeter, Princeton-CUNY, KITP, Mainz, CERN, Fermilab, Saclay, Nordita, IFISC and IFT-Madrid.

Although applications will be accepted until the positions are filled, candidates are strongly encouraged to apply before August 31, 2025 by filling out the online application form at https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/jobs/30083 with a cover letter explaining why they would be a good hire at ICTP-SAIFR, the names of at least 3 researchers who will send recommendation letters, and a curriculum vitae, research project and publication list.
