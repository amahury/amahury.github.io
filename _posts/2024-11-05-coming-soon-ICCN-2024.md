The 9th International Conference on Cognitive Neurodynamics (ICCN 2024), hosted by Hong Kong Baptist University from December 7th-10th, 2024, aims to integrate cognitive science and neurodynamics. This conference will serve as a premier platform for scientists and engineers to showcase the latest advancements, share research insights, and foster collaborative discussions in these dynamic fields.

Participants will have the unique opportunity to engage with leading experts, discover innovative methodologies, and explore new research avenues. They can attend keynote lectures by renowned researchers, participate in interactive discussions, and present their work in various poster and oral sessions. ICCN 2024 will particularly emphasize the interaction between international scholars and Hong Kong researchers, enhancing global academic collaboration.

- Neurodynamics at different levels: Experiment, Neurobiology
- Neurodynamics modelling/computation/methodology/AI
- Neurodynamics applications in cognition, disease, BCI/BMI, neuromodulation

By gathering leading experts to share their cutting-edge research and perspectives, the conference will foster in-depth discussions on unifying concepts and methodologies in cognitive neurodynamics. Our goal is to push the boundaries of knowledge and promote the interdisciplinary collaboration essential for advancing brain science.

**Regular Payment Deadline is Nov 15, 2024**
