### Application Procedure
We only accept application documents online. To apply for the program, you must create an account. Please prepare all required documents in English, save them as PDF files, and upload them to the application website. You can complete the application in one session or save your progress and return to finish it later.

Note: We recommend using a computer when preparing the online application. If you prefer using a mobile device, please make sure to have the latest operating system for the application website to work properly.

### Required Documents
1. Transcript and Diploma: Scanned copies of your current academic transcript and any other transcript from your past degree (BSc, MSc, etc.) along with completed diploma (BSc, MSc, etc.) in PDF format.
 - A scan of an unofficial transcript or other record of grades may be uploaded to the application website
 - English explanation is required for transcripts that are not written in English.
 - If you have not graduated and do not have a diploma yet,please upload a certificate of enrollment from your institution, preferably indicating your expected graduation date.

2. Statement of Purpose: This should be no more than 400 words (2500 characters) and should address the following points:
 - The applicant's scientific interests and aspirations.
 - What the applicant hopes to gain from undertaking graduate studies at OIST.
  
3. Recommendation Letter
Each applicant is required to have at least two and no more than five letters of recommendation written in English from professorial-level faculty who know you and your work personally. Letters from lab members or postdoctoral researchers are not eligible.

If you graduated 5 or more years ago, you may request recommendations from your field-related industry supervisors instead, though faculty recommendations are still preferred. However, industry recommendations should be about your ability to learn and conduct research, rather than generic comments. 

Please ensure you obtain permission and confirm that you have the correct email address before entering contact information. Your recommender will receive an automatic message from OIST requesting them to submit a recommendation letter. Recommenders must follow the instructions provided in the email. OIST does not accept recommendation letters submitted directly by applicants.

Please be considerate of your recommenders and ensure that they have ample time to submit their recommendation letters before the application deadline. OIST does not grant any deadline extensions.

OIST declines to disclose any submitted recommendation letters. To ensure the objectivity of the evaluation, recommendation letters will remain confidential, and applicants will not be permitted to view the letters submitted.

You can only submit your application after at least two recommendation letters are received in the application system.

4. English Proficiency Score
An applicant who is seeking admission on the basis of a qualification from a university for which the language of teaching and/or examination is not English is required to provide a TOEFL iBT or IELTS score obtained within the last two years. Please upload a digital copy of your official score report to the application website.

There is no minimum score required, but the information is needed to determine preparatory course requirements.

5. Passport
The application system requires applicants to provide their passport number and upload a scan of the passport photo page. It is essential for applicants from outside Japan to have a valid passport for travel to Japan. Ensure that you include your passport details during the application process. If you do not have a passport at the time of application, you can upload other government-issued identification documents instead.

6. ID Photo
Please upload a recent photo taken within the last three months, showing your face from the front in standard passport orientation.

### Optional Documents
The following documents may be submitted optionally, and will be taken into consideration if available:
1. Additional evidence of academic ability such as Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) General Test or specific test scores obtained within the last two years.
2. Additional material such as the title and abstract of publications and oral presentations, and other evidence of achievement

Note: The OIST Graduate School reserves the right to request an external evaluation of academic qualifications from any applicant.

### Application Fee
There is no application fee to apply for the OIST PhD Program.

### To Apply
First: please check our list of faculty and research units so you can find one that fits your background and interests. Next, please check their availability to actually supervise PhD students; great applicants can still be rejected if their interested field has no space in the near future. Then please read over our FAQs to avoid making any critical mistakes. Finally, start your application.
