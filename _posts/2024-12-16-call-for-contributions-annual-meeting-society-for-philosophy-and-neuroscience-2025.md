SPAN will host an annual meeting on May 1-3 2025 at Washington University in St. Louis. Meetings consist of invited lectures and symposia, contributed papers, and a poster session. SPAN encourages philosophers and neuroscientists to submit contributed papers and posters to the meeting. In some cases we may ask that a submitted paper be presented as a poster. 

### Submission
**Submission deadline: February 1st, 2025**

Talk Format: Talks are scheduled for 30 minutes; speakers may use up to 25 minutes for talks, and must use at least 5 minutes allotted for Q&A. Talks that are shorter may use the remainder of the 30 minutes for Q&A.

Although submissions are handled separately, talks and poster sessions will be mixed, featuring both neuroscientists and philosophers. 

​Please prepare your submission for blind review by removing all identifying markers. 

​- Submission Type: Extended Abstract

​We expect to send notifications about the status of submissions by the end of February 2025.
