description: Lake Conferences are a new series of 6 bi-annual conferences aiming to provide stimulating forums to broad research communities in key developing areas of neuroscience and cell biology with substantial anticipated potential for society. These conferences are jointly organized by Circuit Neuroscience Basel and the Allen Institute, and are held in Switzerland and the U.S.

### Details
Join the Allen Institute for Cell Science and Circuit Neuroscience Basel in Seattle, Washington, April 20–22, 2026, for a 3 day conference, Modeling Life from Cells to Tissues: Coordination and Robustness, exploring how tissues self-organize from the collective behavior of individual cells. This meeting will bring together biologists, physicists, AI researchers, and theoreticians for engaging presentations, cross-disciplinary discussions, and networking. 

Advances in imaging, synthetic biology, and AI-driven modeling are transforming the study of morphogenesis and self-organization, making it possible to connect molecular mechanisms with emergent multicellular behaviors. Researchers can now test long-standing theories of how cells coordinate to form robust tissues, and how their breakdown contributes to disease. 

This scientific program will feature 27 invited talks, organizer-selected short talks from participants, two poster sessions, and will bring together leaders and early-career researchers for a highly interactive meeting. Lake conferences are medium in size, bringing together 80-100 participants to foster lively discussion, cross-disciplinary collaboration, and exchange of ideas. The program will probe how local rules and cellular agency shape morphogenesis, regeneration, and tissue homeostasis. Through experimental modeling approaches, we will ask how robust patterns emerge, and what their failure reveals about disease.

Key topics include:
- Cell representations beyond gene expression
- Self-organization and coordination
- Engineering multicellularity
- Resilience in biological systems

### Application Details
We invite applicants at all career stages to apply to attend. 

In addition to speaker presentations, we will feature a number of short talks and posters from accepted applicants. Acceptance does not guarantee a short talk time slot, those elected will be notified. 

Applications close on December 12, 2025. All applicants will be notified of the decision on their applications in late January 2026. 

### Registration Cost
The conference registration fee is $650.00 USD for a general ticket and $550.00 for students, to be paid only by accepted applicants after notification. Application is free. Registration includes: 
- Three days of conference sessions
- Evening event (Tuesday, 4/21)
- All meals during the conference 

Please contact events@alleninstitute.org with questions. 

### Venue
This conference will be held at the Allen Institute, a 270,000-square-foot life sciences building, located in South Lake Union neighborhood of Seattle. The building is purpose-built for life science research and facilitates our trademark team science approach amid abundant natural light and with stunning views of Seattle. 

 Upon arrival at the Allen Institute, check in at the registration desk each day located in the lobby and you will be directed to the meeting. Please wear your name badge for the duration of the meeting. 

Accepted applicants will receive additional travel and accommodation details in advance of the event.
