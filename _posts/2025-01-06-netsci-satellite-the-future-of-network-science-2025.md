The Women in Network Science Society welcomes abstract submissions for our half-day satellite at NetSci 2025 in Maastricht. The satellite will include WiNS Pathways talks by invited faculty as well as lightning talks and a poster session highlighting work by trainees. We envision the lightning talk session as an opportunity for multidisciplinary feedback from an encouraging community, and as such we are especially eager to receive submissions for projects in progress. With this format, early career researchers have the opportunity to introduce their work to the field, receive feedback from diverse experts, and build their professional networks.

Accepted submissions will involve both a poster and a lightning talk. Lightning talks will last three minutes each, and we will ask speakers to provide their slides ahead of time. Posters should adhere to the same formatting guidelines as the main conference. 

- **Submission deadline**: February 17th
