### General Info
- Department of Communication and Cognition and Visual Language Lab
- Location: Tilburg 
- Contract size: 0,8 – 1,0 fte (32 - 40 hours per week) 
- Full-time gross monthly salary: €2.901  
- Contract duration: 12 + 36 months 
- Desired starting date: 1 September 2025

The Visual Language Lab within the Department of Communication and Cognition of the Tilburg School of Humanities and Digital Sciences at Tilburg University, invites applications for two PhD positions in the field of psycholinguistics and cognitive neuroscience. The successful candidate will join a research team with Dr. Neil Cohn on the PICTREE Project funded by the European Research Council (ERC). Students on this project will study how the brain processes sequences of narrative images (like in comics) in relation to the sentence structure of languages. Additional information about this research project can be found at www.visuallanguagelab.com/pictree.

### Your position 
The PICTREE Project aims to study how the brain processes pictures and sequences of pictures, like in comics. These PhD positions will study how sequences of images combine images together into hierarchic relationships, which allow for storytelling like comics to have complex sequential relationships. This work will require students to blend linguistic theories and psychological research on visual narrative sequencing and sentence structure, particularly syntax. PhD students will design and carry out cognitive neuroscience (EEG/ERP) experiments examining these issues and will be encouraged to additionally contribute to theory-building. PhD students will also participate in weekly lab meetings and seminars, and will assist in teaching courses and advising thesis projects related to their research.

The Visual Language Lab is the research group of Neil Cohn and colleagues within the Department of Communication and Cognition at Tilburg University. We focus on linguistic and cognitive research on language, graphics, and multimodality, especially in comics or emoji, and we use multiple methods of research including theoretical, experimental, and corpus analyses. We try to cultivate a positive atmosphere where all lab members feel part of a diverse and inclusive team environment that includes professors, postdocs, PhDs, and masters and bachelor’s students. We also have a worldwide network of international collaborators and often have visiting scholars spend extended time in our lab at Tilburg. PhD students will be expected to become active members of our local and international scholarly community and aim to become leaders in this emerging field of research. Additional information can be found at https://www.visuallanguagelab.com.

### Your profile 
- (Research) Masters degree in psychology, linguistics, cognitive neuroscience, cognitive science, and/or a related field.
- Motivated to carry out cutting-edge research, and have shown an interest in research during their studies (either through doing a Research Masters or conducting experiments already).
- An accessible attitude, can function well in a team, and can establish and maintain interpersonal relations, with excellent communication skills in English.
- Ability to take initiative, be organized, be flexible, and work independently
- An interest in comics, drawing, language, linguistics (particularly syntax/grammar and semantics), and (neuro)cognition.
- Previous experience running experiments with language, pictures, and/or comics examining behavioral cognitive processing and/or event-related potentials (EEG/ERP) is a plus.
