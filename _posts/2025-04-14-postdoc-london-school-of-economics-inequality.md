### How to Apply 
The post is part of my Leverhulme-funded “Rep2SI” project (for Reputation and the Reproduction of Social Inequality). The aim is to study the role of reputation – and people's concern about their reputational standing – in perpetuating social inequality. This is an interdisciplinary, mixed methods project: we already have a team of three postdocs and additional collaborators gathering empirical data (primarily, networked experimental economic games) in different rural communities around the world (so far, in India, Colombia, Morocco, Mexico, and Nepal).

This fourth and final postdoc position is intended to add a modeller to the team who can complement and elevate our ethnographic and experimental work. They will work in close collaboration with the team to develop empirically informed models of reputation dynamics on evolving social networks. The plan is for them to develop computational models that translate and quantify our empirical evidence (of social connections, reputational evaluations, and cooperative decision-making) to explore possible mechanisms fuelling social inequality. I broadly expect that the models will draw on (evolutionary) game theory to posit a range of decisions and strategies and explore their individual and collective outcomes, but I leave much to the discretion of the postdoc!

More details on the post (including the job description and person specifications) can be found with the job listing and more details on the larger project at our website (https://rep2si.github.io/). Applications close in just over a month (on 4 May 2025), with an expected start date in the autumn. Feel free to forward this on, as you see fit. Any interested candidates are very welcome to reach out to me.
