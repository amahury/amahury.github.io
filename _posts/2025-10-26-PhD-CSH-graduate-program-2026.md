Society and the planet are facing critical challenges to health and stability. Financial turbulence, depleted natural resources, and the far-reaching impacts of climate change threaten our collective future. Mitigating existing threats, and being prepared to address unknown problems to come, requires science and facts. We need researchers who can develop and apply large-scale computational and data-driven approaches to real-world problems and thereby aid complex decision-making. Effective solutions will need deep collaboration between academic researchers and governments, corporations, and other impact-oriented organizations. The Complexity Science Hub trains students who want to be part of these solutions. Join us and use science to help change the world.

### Program Goals
We are looking for students who want to use their exceptional knowledge and skills to make a meaningful difference in society – whether supporting the green transition, combating crime and misinformation, improving healthcare outcomes, or building more equitable economies. 

Our PhD training program enables students to:
- Recognize the questions of critical importance to the health of society and the planet and that will benefit from large datasets and innovative digital methods and tools
- Use tools and approaches of complex systems and data and network science to address real-world questions
- Work with proprietary datasets and develop novel methods of analysis, modeling, and data visualization to gain a deep understanding of systems
- Communicate and collaborate with decision-makers from government, industry, and other organization and use research to improve practices and implement better policies

### Structure & Curriculum
The program consists of:
- independent  thesis research, determined by each student’s interests
- two ~3-month research exchanges: one in government, public administration, or EU institution; and one in industry or business
- coursework and workshops, including an annual series of CSH “master classes” led by prominent guest lecturers
- participation in the CSH research talk series, with regular presentations
- international scientific conferences and schools, career development support, and transferrable skills training

Thesis research extends from ongoing research at the CSH, often in collaboration with external partners from both academic and non-academic sectors. Each student will identify a Digital Innovation School faculty member to serve as their research advisor and to guide the project. The advisor will help with research project design and realization and help students reach the forefront of science. An advisory team helps the student set and achieve their research goals and adds a broader perspective. The CSH DIS office supports students through all aspects of the thesis. Additional advising is provided by our partner university faculty and staff.

Courses are offered both by CSH and by our partner universities, one of which will serve as the degree-granting entity. Students will be guided to the appropriate university and courses for their interests with the help of their mentor and the graduate program office.

### Timeline & Milestones
The CSH graduate program can be completed in three years, with an optional extension when needed and contingent on funding. Students typically begin in September, and, after a brief orientation and skills workshop, embark on thesis research. Each year of the program includes research, coursework, presentations to the CSH research community, and a graduate student symposium. At least once per year, students meet with their advisory team to discuss progress and set goals. Students must have published, or submitted their work for publication, in order to defend their thesis. CSH expects students to produce at least three first-author research papers. The successful defense and acceptance of the written dissertation by a dissertation  committee are the final steps in the PhD.

### Audience
The program is aimed at students with backgrounds in the natural and social sciences and mathematics who have a strong foundation in quantitative approaches. Applicants should be interested in having a substantial degree of independence in their work and be curious about a breadth of topics within the research areas of the Complexity Science Hub. They should be open communicators, and enjoy collaboration and sharing their expertise and ideas with others.

Students of any nationality are welcome to apply. The program encourages applications from women and persons from groups that have been historically excluded from the sciences. This is an in-person program; accepted students must be willing to relocate to Vienna, Austria, which is continually ranked as one of the world’s most liveable cities.

### Admissions Requirements
- Masters/diploma degree in the natural, physical, or social sciences, mathematics, computer science, engineering, or related disciplines with a strong quantitative foundation; or another degree but with at least two years of full-time research experience in a quantitative area.
- Prior independent research experience so as to be familiar with the research process
- Comfort with a programming language such as Python, R, Mathematica, Matlab, or Julia, or a database management and query language such as SQL; and/or substantial experience with statistical packages such as SPSS, SAS, or Stata
- Proficiency in English*

### Funding
The graduate program has a limited number of fully funded opportunities for exceptional students to do their doctoral studies at the Complexity Science Hub and one of its partner universities. Students receive an annual salary of EUR 39004 (before tax and social security withholding) and an annual EUR 3000 scientific travel allowance. Health insurance and pension is provided.

### How to Apply
We are currently accepting application for the 2026 call. Apply now through our online portal. Applications must be submitted before 11 November 2025 (midnight/24:00 Vienna local time).

There is one application cycle per year. Late applications cannot be accepted. Materials submitted by email will not be accepted except by prior arrangement with the graduate program office.

Applicants will submit:
1. curriculum vitae / CV
2. vision letter / cover letter [What problems would you like to solve? Why is the Complexity Science Hub the right place for you?]
3. portfolio of work
4. two letters of recommendation, sent directly by the recommenders to applications@csh.ac.at
