### Why GECCO?
The Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO) presents the latest high-quality results in genetic and evolutionary computation since 1999. Topics include: genetic algorithms, genetic programming, swarm intelligence, complex systems, evolutionary combinatorial optimization and metaheuristics, evolutionary machine learning, learning for evolutionary computation, evolutionary multiobjective optimization, evolutionary numerical optimization, neuroevolution, real world applications, search-based software engineering, theory, benchmarking, reproducibility, hybrids and more.

### The spot
Málaga is a thriving and dynamic city in Southern Spain. Bathed by the Mediterranean See and surrounded by Málaga Mountains, the city enjoys a warm climate tempered by the proximity of the see. This has contributed to make Málaga one of the main touristic destinations in Europe. The city has however much more to offer than sun and beaches.

Indeed, Málaga is a city of Art & Culture: having been founded by the Phoenicians in 7th century BC and subsequently ruled by Romans, Moors, and Castilian Kings, the city comprises numerous monuments (the Roman Theater, the Moorish Fortress and Castle, the Cathedral, etc.), churches, palaces, and noteworthy buildings that illustrate this historical past.

### General Information
The organizers of GECCO 2025 invite and warmly welcome corporate sponsors. Corporate sponsorships are a fantastic opportunity for companies to have a presence at the premier conference on genetic and evolutionary computation, a key field in artificial and computational intelligence. A corporate presence at GECCO provides a unique opportunity to raise corporate awareness, to interact with leading scientific minds in the field, to cultivate new collaborations, and to reach future employees with high potentials. At the same time, such sponsorships make a key contribution to the continued success of GECCO, including enabling important cross-fertilization between academia and industry. The organization is highly appreciative of your corporate support and participation.

GECCO 2025 in principle identifies the opportunities as outlined below in predefined sponsorship packages, but in general strives to have your sponsorship meet the needs of your company. In particular, this year the sponsorship packages match the hybrid mode of the event, including both an onsite and virtual presence. If you are interested in becoming a corporate sponsor, please contact us at gecco2025@sigevo.org.
