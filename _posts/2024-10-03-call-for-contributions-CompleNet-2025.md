### About the Conference

The International Conference on Complex Networks (CompleNet) will take place from April 22-25, 2025. The event brings together researchers and practitioners from diverse disciplines working on areas related to complex networks. CompleNet has been an active conference since 2009. In its 16th year, we are very enthusiastic to bring it back to South America where we had an amazing experience in 2010. After 15 years a lot has changed about the event but we continue to stay with principles of no parallel sections with a plenary-only configuration.

​Over the past two decades, we have witnessed an exponential increase in the number of publications and research centres dedicated to this field of Complex Networks (aka Network Science). From biological systems to computer science, from technical to informational networks, and from economic to social systems, complex networks are becoming pervasive for dozens of applications. It is the interdisciplinary nature of complex networks that CompleNet aims to capture and celebrate.​

The CompleNet conference is one of the most cherished events by scientists in our field. Maybe it is because of its motivating format, consisting of plenary sessions (no parallel sessions); or perhaps the reason is that it finds the perfect balance between young and senior participation, a balance in the demographics of the presenters, or perhaps it is just the quality of the work presented. Whatever your reason is, we hope that you will join us at the 2025 event. Welcome to CompleNet 2025!
