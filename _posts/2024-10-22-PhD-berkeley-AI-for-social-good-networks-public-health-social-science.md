I am recruiting PhD students this cycle, to start in Fall 2025! I can advise students in EECS or Computational Precision Health (CPH).

### Instructions for applicants
I am interested in working with students from a variety of backgrounds, and I value both personal and professional diversity. I'm generally interested in students who are skilled in ML and data science, care deeply about real-world impact and interdisciplinary work, have strong critical thinking and problem-solving skills, and are clear communicators. A strong research fit is also important, such as interests in AI for public health, computational social science, networks/graphs, or any of the research directions described above.

I'll try to review all applications in related areas, but given the volume of applications, including my name makes it much likelier that your application will be flagged to me.
- If you are applying for EECS: (1) when entering your faculty preference on the application, write in my name in the free text box below the dropdowns (see instructions regarding new faculty on the EECS Admissions page), (2) include my name in your Statement of Purpose.
- If you are applying for CPH: (1) when entering your faculty preference on the application, write in my name for one of the "Faculty Preference" text boxes, (2) include my name in your Statement of Purpose. I will also be paying special attention to applications that select "Community and Public Health" under Health Research Topics.
