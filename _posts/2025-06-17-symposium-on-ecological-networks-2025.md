### Introduction
The School of Natural and Environmental Sciences at Newcastle University, UK are delighted to be hosting the VII Symposium on Ecological Networks. This year our broad theme is ‘Network Ecology in the Anthropocene’ and is intended to bring together biologists, theoretical physicists, computational and social scientists who work on network theory or use it as an approach to understand the structure and functioning of biological communities. As always, we believe that the symposium will be an excellent opportunity to share cutting-edge methodologies and new results and serve as a platform to develop joint projects in the future.

This year our broad theme is ‘Network Ecology in the Anthropocene’ and is intended to bring together biologists, theoretical physicists, computational and social scientists who work on network theory or use it as an approach to understand the structure and functioning of biological communities.

The two-day conference takes place on the 3rd and 4th September. The rates below include entry to the conference, refreshments and food throughout and attendance at the conference dinner on Wednesday 3rd September.

### Additional workshop: Molecular analysis of trophic interactions
There is an optional workshop prior to the main Symposium running on Monday 1st and Tuesday 2nd September. Please note that places are limited and offered on a first come, first served basis. If you are interested in attending, please check the box in the registration form below.

The construction of ecological networks using molecular data has become increasingly commonplace over the last decade, and methods like DNA metabarcoding are an increasingly important component of the network ecologist’s toolbox.

In this workshop, we will go through the process of analysing the gut contents of invertebrate predators using dietary DNA metabarcoding. From considerations for field sampling through DNA extraction and PCR, to DNA library preparation and nanopore sequencing, this workshop will cover the full process and will generate real sequencing data for downstream analysis by any participants of the workshop.

### Additional field trip: Bamburgh Castle
On Friday 5th September there will be an optional additional field trip up to Bamburgh Castle, where you will get to explore the stunning North East coast line, visit the Castle and enjoy a traditional afternoon tea on return to campus. 

### Registration
Registration is now open! Click the button below to be directed to our registration site. 

We have worked hard to keep costs low, especially for students attending for the first time. Registration costs include entry to the conference, refreshments and food throughout and attendance at the conference dinner on Wednesday 3rd September:
- Student ticket: £80
- Standard ticket: £140

There is an optional molecular analysis of trophic interactions workshop (limited paces) on the 1st and 2nd September which can be added for an additional £22.

There is also an optional field trip to Bamburgh Castle on Friday 5th September, including coaches to and from Newcastle city centre, entry to Bamburgh Castle and afternoon tea on return to campus. This can also be added for an additional £38.

**Please submit your abstract by Friday 20th June in order for it to be considered.**

### Accommodation
Symposium attendees need to book their own accommodation and there are options that suit a variety of budgets across the city. 

The Newcastle Gateshead Convention Bureau have provided some discounted options for the duration of EcoNet2025 and the accommodation booking site is [here](https://ngcb.hotelplanner.com/Event/83f2/).

### Travel
The city of Newcastle-upon-Tyne is well served by an international airport (NCL), train station on the East Coast Main Line, coach service (e.g. National Express) and national road network (A1). Trains from London take approximately 3 hours (including a non-stop service with Lumo) and 1.5 hours from Edinburgh. Delegates are advised to book early to take advantage of the cheapest deals. 

The city is served by the Tyne and Wear Metro (nexus.org.uk) with direct links to the airport and Newcastle Central Station. The nearest Metro station to the University is Haymarket. As a city campus, you can enjoy being in the heart of a vibrant, cultural hub.
