description: The Department of Mathematics at Dartmouth College invites applications for a postdoctoral appointment that can start as early as December 1, 2024. This appointment will be under the direction of Professor Peter Mucha, with potential funding through grants from the ARL, NIDDK and NSF on different applications of network science in interdisciplinary collaborations for modeling within-person dynamics of cognitive processes, modeling disease transmission at the human/animal interface, and metabolomic data analysis. Specific areas of research interest include community detection, higher-order interactions, link prediction, statistical analysis of time series from dynamical processes, and other areas of scientific machine learning.

Successful applicants may also have the opportunity to work interdisciplinarily with faculty affiliated with the Jack Byrne Academic Cluster in Mathematics and Decision Science — Dimitris Giannakis (Mathematics), Peter Mucha (Mathematics), and James Smith (Tuck School of Business) — as well as other faculty in data and decision science across the College. Areas of research interest in the Cluster include but are not limited to climate monitoring and forecasting, decision analysis and dynamic programming, dynamical systems, and network science applications in the behavioral and biomedical sciences. 

Applicants must hold (or expect to hold by the start date of their appointment) a Ph.D. in Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, Computer Science, Engineering, Physics, Statistics, or a related field. Successful applicants are expected to be no more than 3 years past their doctorate. The ideal candidate will have a background related to one or more of the research areas described above as well as a keen, demonstrable interest in interdisciplinary collaboration. 

The postdoctoral appointee could have the opportunity to teach one or two ten-week courses in the Mathematics Department, contingent on course availability and teaching qualifications. Salary will be adjusted accordingly and set by the Associate Dean of the Arts and Sciences Division.

The postdoctoral positions are intended for two to three years, with an initial one-year appointment renewable contingent upon performance. 

Located in Hanover, New Hampshire, Dartmouth College is an Ivy League university that offers students, postdoctoral scholars, and faculty a close-knit academic community with global reach. Part of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the Department of Mathematics has 24 tenured and tenure-track faculty members, a strong PhD program, and outstanding undergraduate majors. Members of the department have collaborative connections across campus. In addition, postdoctoral scholars and graduate students are supported by the Guarini School for Graduate and Advanced Studies, including their diversity and inclusion initiatives. A complete list of all current openings in Mathematics can be found on our website: http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/activities/recruiting/.

Dartmouth is committed to academic excellence and encourages the open exchange of ideas within a culture of mutual respect. People with different backgrounds, life experiences, and perspectives make the Dartmouth community diverse, which enhances academic excellence. In addition, we value applicants who have a demonstrated ability to contribute to Dartmouth’s undergraduate diversity initiatives in STEM research, such as the Women in Science Program, E. E. Just STEM Scholars Program, and Academic Summer Undergraduate Research Experience (ASURE). Applicants should include a statement that addresses how their research, teaching, service, and/or life experiences prepare them to advance Dartmouth’s commitment to diversity in service of academic excellence.

Applicants should submit the following via MathJobs:
- Cover letter,
- Curriculum vitae,
- Statement of research experience, plans and interests,
- Statement of pedagogical experience and interests,
- Statement that addresses how the applicant’s research, teaching, service, and/or life experiences prepare them to    advance Dartmouth’s commitment to diversity in service of academic excellence; and.
- At least three, preferably four, letters of recommendation. At least one reference should address the applicant’s ability as a teacher and, if the applicant’s native language is not English, the applicant’s ability to use English in the classroom. At least two references should address the applicant’s research ability.

The Department will give first consideration to applications completed by October 15, 2024, but will accept applications until available positions are filled.
