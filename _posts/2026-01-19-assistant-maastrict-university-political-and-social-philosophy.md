### General Info
FASoS is a close-knit, international community of thinkers, doers, and connectors. We provide interdisciplinary education in the humanities and social sciences, and our research examines societies in transition.

Our work focuses on themes such as European integration, digitalization, governance, culture, innovation, and societal change. Creativity, collaboration, and curiosity are central to how we work. FASoS is informal, diverse, and small-scale — with room to grow, explore, and shape your own academic path.

Here, you contribute to education and research that help make sense of the evolving political landscape in Europe and the world. You join an international academic community where critical thinking, collaboration, and curiosity drive everything we do — and where your philosophical perspective helps students and colleagues engage thoughtfully with today’s most pressing democratic challenges.

- Your colleagues: A diverse and international group of philosophers working across political philosophy, philosophy of technology, and philosophy of art and culture at the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences (FASoS).
