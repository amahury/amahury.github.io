### Information about _Animal Behaviour_
Animal Behaviour is published for the Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour in collaboration with the Animal Behavior Society. The current publishers are Elsevier.

First appearing in 1953, Animal Behaviour is a leading international publication with wide appeal, containing research articles (primary research, methods and data set papers), critical reviews, commentaries and book reviews. Special Issues are commissioned on occasion. The journal publishes fundamental and applied empirical work, as well as theory, focused on the behaviour of any animals, including humans.

From January 2025, Animal Behaviour publishes online only, with papers appearing with an article number and DOI once proofs are approved. Papers are also collated into monthly collections with Editors’ choices.

Each year, prizes are awarded for papers published by students, early-career researchers and authors from institutes in a Low- or Middle-income country in the World Bank’s classification.

Animal Behaviour considers any paper where there is a core behaviour focus. Topics of interest include (this is not an exhaustive list): animal welfare, behavioural ecology, cognition, conservation, development of behaviour, ethology, evolution of behaviour, global change biology, neuroethology, physiology, population biology, psychology, sensory biology and sociobiology.

### Information about ASAB
ASAB was founded in 1936 to promote the study of animal behaviour. Membership is open to all who share our interests. There are now around 1000 members, the majority drawn from Britain and Europe. Many members are professional biologists who work in universities, research institutes and schools.

ASAB is committed to promoting a diverse and inclusive community, and aims to ensure fair and equitable representation and participation throughout all of ASAB’s activities and in the wider animal behaviour research community, irrespective of characteristics including but not limited to age, disability, ethnicity, gender, and sexuality.

ASAB promotes (a) the study of animal behaviour by holding conferences and funding research; (b) the publication of animal behaviour research through its Society journal Animal Behaviour; (c) the ethical treatment and conservation of animals through our Ethical Committee; and (d) the teaching of animal behaviour in schools through our Education Committee.
