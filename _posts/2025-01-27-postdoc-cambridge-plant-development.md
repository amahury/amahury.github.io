### About
The lab is investigating the mechanistic basis of the function of the plant hormone cytokinin (CK) in plant development using Arabidopsis thaliana as model. CK is a fundamental plant hormone that is conventionally considered to promote cell division in plant aerial organs but surprisingly, can also promote cellular differentiation and expansion in aerial organs, in a stage-dependent manner. Therefore, the roles of CK in shaping plant aerial organs are much more diverse than previously thought. How CK regulates and coordinates cell proliferation, differentiation and expansion decisions remain largely unclear. By integrating genetic analyses including genetic mosaics, time-lapse imaging, cellular growth quantifications, and single cell omics, our lab investigates (i) how CK regulates cell proliferation and differentiation and (ii) how are these distinct cellular effects coordinated in space and time during aerial organ development. We are in the process of developing cellular and molecular frameworks of CK-mediated coordination of cell proliferation and differentiation that shape plant organ form.

The candidate will be working in a stimulating scientific environment with ample opportunities to learn new techniques. The successful candidate will be encouraged to apply for fellowships with the help of the lab.

### Requirements
Successful applicants must have a recent PhD degree (within one-two years is desirable but not essential) with strong foundations in plant developmental biology, genetics and molecular biology. Expertise in basic molecular biology techniques and generation and handling of transgenic plants preferably but not limited to Arabidopsis is essential. Experience with confocal microscopy and time-lapse imaging of plant aerial organs -leaves and the shoot apical meristem is desirable and will be an advantage. We are looking for a future colleague with strong communication skills, critical thinking and problem-solving abilities, and who is enthusiastic to work in a collaborative environment and contribute to a young lab as it grows. If you are passionate about research in plant development, possess the necessary technical skills and qualities, and are enthusiastic to learn new cutting-edge techniques, we invite you to apply for this exciting opportunity.

It is essential that you include a motivation letter in your application clearly stating why you are interested in our work, your future research interests and how your research experience may align with the advert.

### Our Offer
At the Sainsbury Laboratory, we foster a welcoming and collaborative environment. We offer a range of family- friendly benefits and development opportunities to our employees. Successful applicants will join a friendly, interactive research environment with centralized support for horticulture, microscopy, and other facilities like media kitchen.
