### Disinformation
Disinformation is false or misleading information created and spread to advance policy, political, economic or ideological goals. It is sometimes used by industries, governments, and other entities to undermine the public good and the knowledge institutions crucial to a functioning democracy. A by the World Economic Forum ranked disinformation together with misinformation as a top global risk.

### DSI Goals
The Disinformation Summer Institute (DSI) is organized around two goals: (1) to break down barriers between fields of scholarship tackling disinformation and (2) to prepare the next generation of scholars with the interdisciplinary skills necessary to tackle the challenges associated with this topic of study.

### Program Details
Applications are now open for the second annual Disinformation Summer Institute. This 4-day event will take place June 15-18, 2026 at the IslandWood Retreat on Bainbridge Island near Seattle. The first summer institute took place at the Martin Johnson House, Scripps Institute for Oceanography, UC San Diego, La Jolla, CA in June of 2025.

The summer institute is intended primarily for advanced PhD candidates, advanced law and medical students, post-docs, assistant professors and early career researchers seeking to better understand and address disinformation, but more senior scholars and practitioners who have recently moved into this domain are also encouraged to apply.

The Institute will bring together early career researchers and senior experts to share concepts, techniques, history, and theories useful in the fight against disinformation.  Drawing upon quantitative and qualitative social science, history, philosophy of science, legal scholarship, public health, data science, and more, each day will combine lectures by experts, group panels, and open discussion.

Cost: There is no fee for the Summer Institute. The cost of economy travel and lodging will be covered for graduate students and at least partially defrayed for post-docs and assistant professors. Please indicate on the application form what you will need.

Applications are due February 15th, 2026.
