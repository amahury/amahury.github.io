### About the university
The University of Konstanz is one of eleven Universities of Excellence in Germany. Since 2007 it has been successful in the German Excellence Initiative and its follow-up program, the Excellence Strategy.

The Department of Politics and Public Administration conducts research and teaching at the highest level in the areas of (i) democracy and public policy, (ii) international politics, (iii) management and public administration, and (iv) data and methods.

### Our offer
The successful candidate utilizes, evaluates and develops text-as-data methods to tackle policy-relevant problems. A focus on the application of Large Language Models to the analysis of textual resources such as legal texts, parliamentary speeches, media content, social media posts, and open-ended survey questions will be particularly welcome.

The professorship will offer courses in text-as-data methods including LLMs, their applications in social science research, and their mathematical foundations.  It will thus contribute to the undergraduate and graduate programs at the Department of Politics and Public Administration, the interdisciplinary Master’s program in Social and Economic Data Science (SEDS), and the Advanced Data and Information Literacy Track (ADILT). Involvement in the Cluster of Excellence “The Politics of Inequality” is welcome.

The position requires an excellent doctoral degree in one of the social sciences, computer science, or statistics with an evident interdisciplinary inclination. Applicants should have a promising research record, substantiated through publications in high-ranking journals, as well as relevant teaching experience in the above-mentioned field.  We place great emphasis on gender and diversity competence, reflected in teaching and research. The ability to teach in German is an advantage but not a requirement.
