The Hunter Medical Research Institute (HMRI) and the University of Newcastle (UoN), in partnership with the National Imaging Facility (NIF), are seeking a Data Infrastructure Specialist to join our state-of-the-art Magnetic Resonance Imaging Centre. This newly created, fully funded role supports transformative neuroscience and brain cancer research by enabling robust data management and advanced computational workflows.

Working at the intersection of imaging, neuroscience, and IT, you’ll contribute to the success of the National Imaging Facility and help researchers make critical discoveries through powerful, secure, and scalable data platforms.

### The Role
As the Data Infrastructure Specialist, you’ll play a central role in the management and development of imaging data systems across HMRI, UoN, the Systems Neuroscience Group, and the Mark Hughes Foundation Centre for Brain Cancer Research. You will:
- Design and maintain research data workflows connecting neuroimaging formats (e.g., DICOM, NIFTI, CIFTI, BIDS) to high-performance computing (HPC) environments.
- Support research teams by ensuring secure, accessible, and scalable imaging data infrastructure—integrating modalities such as MRI, EEG, and behavioural data.
- Train and mentor researchers, providing tools, documentation, and workshops to help them manage and process their imaging data independently and effectively.
- Oversee informatics platforms (e.g., XNAT) and advise on key software tools (e.g., SPM, FSL, Freesurfer) and hardware integration for data acquisition and analysis.
- Collaborate on national-scale data initiatives, contributing to the development of federated data platforms and AI-based data analysis frameworks across the NIF network.

This position sits across multiple research teams, providing expert data infrastructure support to a wide community of investigators, while helping to shape a national strategy for imaging data governance and integration.

### What you’ll bring
You're a systems thinker and a technical problem solver with a background in IT, data science, physics, computer science, bioinformatics, or systems neuroscience. You’re motivated by the opportunity to build and shape data infrastructure that accelerates scientific discovery.

This is a rare opportunity to shape the future of data infrastructure in biomedical imaging research. You’ll be at the heart of a collaborative, national effort to improve how imaging data is stored, analysed, and shared—unlocking discoveries in brain and other medical sciences and beyond.

This fixed term position is full time at a HEW 7 Higher Education Level until the end of June 2027 located at HMRI.
