### Selection Procedure
1. **Eligibility Check**
  - To be eligible to apply to IMPRS you must hold a Master of Science degree, Diploma, or equivalent. It is not necessary to have the degree at time of application, however, you must have been awarded your degree prior to start of the doctorate program (envisaged 1 September, 2025). You must be fluent in written and spoken English. We do not require an official language certificate, but your proficiency will be tested in the interview phase by the panel.
2. **Project / Supervisor Choice**
  - Please review the project descriptions and engage with the associated material.
  - Candidates seeking more information about the project are strongly encouraged to contact the principal investigator directly at the email address listed in the project description prior to submitting their formal application.
  - Having decided upon a project / supervisor you will prepare a formal application.
  - You can apply for a maximum of two projects.
3. **Formal Application**
  - Your application will include a letter of motivation addressed to the appropriate principal investigator (max. 1 page), your CV, your bachelor and/or master degree plus transcript of records, and contact information for two references. The letter should include an explanation of why you wish to pursue a doctorate and provide a reasoned scientific argument for your choice of project.
  - Applications without a clear connection between the motivation letter and the described project will not be further considered.
  - You should combine all parts of the application in a single PDF. We explicitly ask you to refrain from submitting application photos. If applying for two projects, you must tender two separate applications, each specifically tailored to the described project. Once again, generic applications will be rejected.
  - The portal will be open until 26 January.

### Appraisal Process
Applications will be forwarded to the relevant principal investigator who will contact you if they wish to proceed with your application. Suitable applicants will be invited to a first (online only) interview.

Those who cannot be considered for the Selection Symposium will receive an email, but not before February 12th, 2025.

Applications will be reviewed by the application panel. Shortlisted candidates will be invited to visit the host institution March 31st-April 1st, under the condition that travelling and in-person meetings will be possible. If not, this final round of interviews will also take place via video conference. Directly after the selection symposium, the IMPRS faculty will decide who of the candidates will be offered a position.

Successful candidates will be notified as soon as possible after the final decision.
