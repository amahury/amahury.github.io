### About
The Department of AI and Society (AIS) at the University at Buffalo (UB) invites candidates to apply for multiple positions as Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, or Full Professor.

The new AIS department was created with the goal of creating AI systems that are designed to be built by society, for society. We seek to upend the dominant approach where AI systems are built with accuracy as the primary metric and then “fine tuned” for societal considerations. A successful candidate is expected to contribute to our initial attempts to make this vision a reality. To that end, we are looking for candidates who can operate effectively in a team environment with a diverse community of students and faculty, and who share and want to help shape our vision for a new department in the field of AI and Society.

Review of applications will begin immediately with start dates in Fall 2025 and beyond; applications will be considered until all positions are filled.

The AIS department seeks to hire interdisciplinary scholars whose research agenda connects the study of AI with humanistic and/or social scientific line(s) of study and are open to hire scholars with training in a wide range of home disciplines, including (but not limited to) Social Work, History, Computer Science, Engineering, Public Health, Digital Media and Art, Education, Psychology, Sociology, Geography, Languages and Literatures, etc. We expect a successful applicant to be a transdisciplinary researcher who incorporates insights across AI and the arts, humanities and/or one or more of the social sciences.

We envision successful candidates might include scholars who:
- Use methodologies, theories, and/or concepts from the arts, humanities and/or social sciences to develop new kinds of AI (e.g. new models or new uses of existing models informed by humanistic or social scientific theory);
- Use AI to engage social science questions (e.g. computational social science) or humanistic lines of inquiry (e.g. digital humanities concerned with social change and justice);
- Develop community-driven (e.g. participatory-design-based) AI solutions to address societal problems (e.g. HCI, Human Factors, and other design scholars specializing in community work);
- Pursue critical work on AI through a social scientific or humanistic lens (e.g. critical algorithm studies or critical artistic work).

These lines of inquiry are by no means exhaustive, but reflect our belief as a department that 1) we cannot have AI systems that are built for society without undertaking meaningful analyses of the strengths and weaknesses of existing AI systems, 2) that AI can, if used effectively, be an important tool in the social sciences, humanities, and arts, and 3) that attempts to build “AI for social good” that do not involve impacted communities from the start of the design process are doomed to fail. Given that AIS is a new department, initially, all faculty members are expected to fully engage and participate in the building of a new department including but not limited to
- Developing a vision for the department that encompasses its role in enhancing training opportunities and engaging communities around issues related to AI and society,
- Developing department policies and procedures,
- Creating undergraduate and graduate programs, including developing and implementing new courses, in the department.

In the steady state, successful candidates will be expected to teach courses at the graduate and undergraduate levels, mentor graduate students, advise students at all levels, and maintain an active research program. The successful Associate Professor or Full Professor candidates should also have a record of scholarly accomplishments, teaching experience, and a record of sustained external funding through grants, fellowships, or foundations. We also expect any successful candidate to work with faculty and experts from multiple fields within the AIS department and/or the UB community in general.
