In A *History of Bodies, Brains, and Minds*, Francisco Aboitiz provides a brief history of life, the brain, and cognition, from the earliest living beings to our own species. The author proceeds from the basic premise that, since evolution by natural selection is the process underlying the origin of life and its evolution on earth, the brain—and thus our minds—must also be the result of biological evolution. The aim of this book is to narrate how animal bodies came to be built with their nervous systems and how our species evolved with culture, technology, language, and consciousness.

The book is organized in four parts, each delving into a different aspect of evolutionary development:
- **Definitions** lays the groundwork by discussing the principles of biological evolution and explores the definition and mechanisms of life itself.
- **Beginnings** describes the origins of life, starting from the emergence of the first cells to the development of neurons as the building blocks for brain networks.
- **The Rise of Bodies and Brains** examines the evolution of animals with bilateral symmetry, the emergence of chordates and vertebrates, and the expansion and diversification of the vertebrate brain.
- **A Singular Ape** explores Homo sapiens and our species' unique traits, such as bipedality, tool use, culture, language, communication, and consciousness.

Comprehensive and deeply insightful, this book helps us understand our place in the natural world and the cosmos—as well as what the future might hold for life on earth.
