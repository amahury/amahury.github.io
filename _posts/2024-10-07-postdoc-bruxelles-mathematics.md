*(Please note: review of the applications will start on December 1st, 2024, and will continue until the position is filled.)*

A two-year postdoctoral fellowship in Geometry and Geometric Analysis is available at the Université Libre de Bruxelles. The differential geometry group at the ULB is a dynamic research group with an excellent international reputation and a lively community of PhD students and postdoctoral researchers. The members of the group have extensive collaborations and links with other research institutions from around the globe. The group is active in Riemannian Geometry, Symplectic Geometry, Gauge Theory and Geometric Analysis. See the website geometry.ulb.be for more information. 

The ULB has an excellent mathematics department providing a stimulating research environment. The department is located in the pleasant and green setting of the "La Plaine" campus in the heart of Brussels.

The position will be funded by the "Excellence of Science" FNRS grant “Beyond Symplectic Geometry”. The candidate will be expected to work with Joel Fine and Bruno Premoselli, but interactions with other members of the geometry group of the ULB are welcome. Main research topics for this position include special holonomy, Einstein metrics, conformal geometry and geometric PDEs, but all candidates with a strong background in geometric analysis are encouraged to apply.    

### Practical information:
- The postdoc position is full-time for two years, with a salary starting at approx. net 2700eur/month after all taxes. Salary may be higher depending on seniority (it is tipycally of approx. net 3100eur/month with two to three years of seniority post-Ph.D) and social security is included.
- Financial support to attend conferences, workshops, and to invite collaborators is available.
- There are no teaching obligations (although teaching opportunities are available should the successful candidate be interested).
- The starting date is flexible and can be any time up to December 2025.

### Requirements for this position:
- The applicant is required to have obtained a Ph.D by the time the position starts.
- The applicant should not have lived in Belgium for more than 24 out of the 36 months before the first day of the position.

**Review of the applications will start on December 1st, 2024, and will continue until the position is filled.**

Applications should be sent by email to both Bruno Premoselli (bruno.premoselli@ulb.be) and Joel Fine (joel.fine@ulb.be) and should include:  
- a CV with a list of publications
- a .pdf file of what the candidate considers to be their best research achievement (only one file: published paper or preprint are both ok).
- a 2-page description of research interests,
- the names of 2 people who will provide recommendation letters. (These names should include one PhD advisor if the applicant has no prior post-doc experience, and should avoid coauthors.)
- Please ask your letter-writers to e-mail their letters directly to Bruno Premoselli and Joel Fine. Your application will not be considered until these letters arrive.
