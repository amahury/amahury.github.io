### General Info
The National Center for Research in Energy and Materials (CNPEM), a social organization supervised by the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovations (MCTI), holds the Summer Scholarship Program (PBV) every year. The main goal of this program is to spread science and encourage young students to pursue careers in science and tech development. 

The program is aimed at students enrolled in undergraduate courses in the fields of Exact and Earth Sciences (including Engineering and Technology) and Biological and Health Sciences at universities located in Latin American and Caribbean countries. The challenge for each selected student is to develop a multi- and/or interdisciplinary research project proposed by CNPEM researchers and present their results in the form of seminars and a final research report. 

The PBV was first held in January and February 1992, when the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS) was developing a project for an electron accelerator to produce synchrotron light, the first equipment of its kind in the Southern Hemisphere. Since that year, the Program has been held regularly during the summer months in Brazil, which is also the vacation period for university students in Latin America and the Caribbean.
