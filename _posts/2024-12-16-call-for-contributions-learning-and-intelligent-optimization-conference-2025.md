This meeting, which continues the successful series of LION events started 18 years ago (latest editions LION18 @ Ischia, Italy, LION17 @ Nice, France), is exploring the intersections and uncharted territories between machine learning, artificial intelligence, mathematical programming and algorithms for hard optimization problems.

The main purpose of the venue is to bring together experts from these areas to discuss new ideas and methods, challenges and opportunities in various application areas, general trends and specific developments.

The large variety of heuristic algorithms for hard optimization problems raises numerous interesting and challenging issues. Practitioners are confronted with the burden of selecting the most appropriate method, in many cases through an expensive algorithm configuration and parameter tuning process, and subject to a steep learning curve. Scientists seek theoretical insights and demand a sound experimental methodology for evaluating algorithms and assessing strengths and weaknesses. A necessary prerequisite for this effort is a clear separation between the algorithm and the experimenter, who, in too many cases, is "in the loop" as a crucial intelligent learning component. Both issues are related to designing and engineering ways of "learning" about the performance of different techniques, and ways of using past experience about the algorithm behavior to improve performance in the future. Intelligent learning schemes for mining the knowledge obtained from different runs or during a single run can improve the algorithm development and design process and simplify the applications of high-performance optimization methods. Combinations of algorithms can further improve the robustness and performance of the individual components provided that sufficient knowledge of the relationship between problem instance characteristics and algorithm performance is obtained.

### Submissions
When submitting a paper to LION 19, authors are required to select one of the following three types of papers:
- Long paper: original novel and unpublished work (12- 15 pages in LNCS format);
- Short paper: an extended abstract of novel work (6-11 pages in LNCS format);
- Abstract: for oral presentation only (maximum 1000 words in LNCS format).

Please prepare your paper in English using the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) template. Papers must be submitted in PDF.

Please note that the review process for LION 19 is single blind.

Papers accepted into the LION19 proceedings will be published in Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS).

### Travel Information
The LION 19 will be held in a historical building in Malá Strana in the heart of Prague. It is close to many tourist attractions: It is right next to the St. Nicholas Church and on the main tourist road from Prague Castle, across Charles Bridge to Old Town Hall with an Astronomical Clock. The building is located at: Malostranské nám. 25, 118 00 Praha 1-Malá Strana.

Keep in mind that the Czech Republic is a member of the European Union and a Schengen country. Then, a valid passport or, for Schengen countries, an identification card is all that is needed for entry into the Czech Republic by citizens of European Union countries. Guests from many countries, including the United States, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, and Iceland, can enter the Czech Republic without a visa. If you need a visa to enter the Czech Republic and attend the LION 19 conference, do not hesitate to contact us to request an official invitation letter.
