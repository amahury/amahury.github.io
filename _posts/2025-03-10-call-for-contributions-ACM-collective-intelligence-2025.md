description: ACM Collective Intelligence 2025 brings together a wide range of disciplines to discuss the shared or group intelligence that emerges when individuals work together, often with the help of technology. This year’s theme focuses on Diverse Intelligence. We invite research and perspectives on how we can deeply understand and build systems that incorporate animal, human, machine and hybrid intelligence to achieve a level of problem-solving capability that surpasses the abilities of any single member.

### General Info
ACM Collective Intelligence 2025 brings together a wide range of disciplines to discuss the shared or group intelligence that emerges when individuals work together, often with the help of technology. This year’s theme focuses on Diverse Intelligence. We invite research and perspectives on how we can deeply understand and build systems that incorporate animal, human, machine and hybrid intelligence to achieve a level of problem-solving capability that surpasses the abilities of any single member. 

Rarely do researchers have this opportunity to interact with such a broad range of disciplines—cognitive science, philosophy, ecology, biology, computer science, anthropology, organizational science, network science, sociology, economics, business, and many others. Join us to advance our collective understanding of how to harness our collective abilities.

### Venue
Sunny San Diego along with the Pacific coastline, provides the perfect backdrop for CI. The city's natural wonders like La Jolla Cove blend seamlessly with cultural landmarks such as Balboa Park and Cabrillo National Monument, offering a rich landscape for intellectual discovery. Savor the diverse culinary scene, from Mexican-influenced street food to Asian delicacies in the Convoy district and Middle Eastern specialties along El Cajon Boulevard. For the adventurous spirit, San Diego offers endless outdoor activities - from scenic hiking trails to ocean experiences like snorkeling, scuba diving, and surfing, to soaring over the coast while paragliding.

### Topics of Interest
ACM Collective Intelligence is the premier venue for disseminating the latest research that advances the theoretical and empirical understanding of collective performance in diverse systems, whether biological, technological, or a combination. We are interested in research on a broad range of systems that vary in scale and scope and focus on implications for a diverse range of social, ecological, and economic outcomes.

The ACM Collective Intelligence (CI) Conference has a transdisciplinary focus devoted to advancing the theoretical and empirical understanding of collective intelligence, broadly designed. The community does basic science on emergent collective phenomena, as well as designing and engineering systems for combining computational and human intelligence. We are interested in research on a broad range of phenomena that vary in scale and scope with implications for a diverse range of social, ecological, and economic outcomes.

Researchers who participate in the CI conference represent a wide and growing cross-section of social science and computer science as well the natural sciences, arts, and humanities. All types of contributions—empirical, conceptual, theoretical, quantitative, and qualitative—are welcome, including computational models.

Topics include (but are not limited to) research that helps us to explain the mechanisms of emergent behavior as well as presentations of design solutions and systems engineering.

Research on collective behaviors including, but not limited to:
- Crowds, flocks and swarms
- Collective emotion and polarization
- Belief formation and misinformation
- Social network formation and functioning
- Science and innovation
- Open source communities
- Organizational Studies

Research into systems and tasks to support the following, but not limited to: 
- Forecasting and decision-making
- Democracy, civics and policymaking
- Complex problem solving
- Crisis response
- Community-driven design
- Innovation contests
- Citizen science
- Discussion moderation and decision facilitation
- Computer-human collaboration (e.g. hybrid systems, LLMs)

### Submission Options
The two primary submission formats—full papers and extended abstracts—are intended to accommodate the different norms and requirements across the diverse fields represented in the Collective Intelligence community. Both formats will have an equal chance of acceptance, and are equally likely to be invited for inclusion as an oral presentation or as a poster. Submissions will be selected for inclusion based on their quality and the fit of their topic with the interests of the CI ‘25 audience. The key differences between formats (see below) relate to the amount of feedback authors will receive and opportunities for inclusion in archival proceedings and/or consideration for journal publication. The format selected at the time of initial submission cannot be changed at a later point in the process.

- Full papers will be assigned to a Program Committee member who will recruit 3 external reviewers and write a meta-review. Reviewers will be instructed to write full reviews that evaluate submissions according to specific review criteria. Accepted full papers will be published in the archival 2025 ACM Collective Intelligence conference proceedings which will be available via the ACM Digital Library. These papers will be assigned individual digital object identifiers as citable publications. Note: authors submitting to the full paper track are expected to serve as a reviewer on at least one paper.
- Extended abstracts will receive short reviews by two members of the Program Committee. Accepted abstracts will be made available to conference participants on the CI’25 website. These abstracts will not be archived in the ACM library nor assigned individual DOIs for tracking future citations. This option may be attractive to social science researchers who wish to submit their work to a journal for archival publication.
- Other submission options include: a non-archival Demos and Posters track that gives researchers and practitioners an opportunity to share their work in an interactive format. A Doctoral Colloquium for current PhD students to get input on their thesis direction. The hands-on CrowdCamp (a stable of the HCOMP community) is a workshop where researchers of all stripes can prototype early-stage ideas. Teams may also submit proposals for additional Workshops to be offered to attendees.

Attendance and presentations: Accepted full papers and extended abstracts will be invited to give verbal presentations at the conference. To ensure your accepted submission will be included in the conference program, at least one author of each accepted submission must register to attend the conference by the camera-ready submission deadline. Failure to do so will result in the withdrawal of the paper. In-person attendance is required as remote presentations are only allowed under exceptional circumstances.

In the submission form, authors of full papers and extended abstracts may check an option to be automatically considered for a poster or demo presentation if the submission is not accepted for a verbal presentation.

Paper awards: ​CI’25 will recognize one best full paper, one best extended abstract, and one best student submission (of any type). Reviewers will be asked to flag papers they deem worthy of a recognition. The program chairs will form a small committee that will read the nominated papers, consider the comments of the reviewers, and assess submissions to determine winners.
