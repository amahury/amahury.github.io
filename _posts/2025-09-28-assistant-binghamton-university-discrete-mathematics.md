### Job Description
The Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Binghamton University invites applications for a tenure-track position as a Simons Empire Faculty Fellow to begin in Fall 2026 at the rank of Assistant Professor. We seek outstanding candidates with expertise in discrete mathematics, with particular interest in candidates whose research advances the mathematical foundations of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and quantum information and computation.

Successful candidates must have a strong record of research and teaching and should complement or strengthen our existing research group. Applications from underrepresented groups are especially welcome.

This position is part of a prestigious four-faculty Simons Empire Faculty Fellowship cluster hire at Binghamton University, comprising two mathematics & statistics positions and two physics positions. The cluster is designed to foster collaborative research at the intersection of quantum science and mathematical foundations of artificial intelligence, directly advancing the Simons Foundation's mission to push the frontiers of mathematics and basic sciences through interdisciplinary collaboration. While the primary expectation is that fellows will develop strong, independent research programs within their disciplines, the cluster also offers unique opportunities for interdisciplinary engagement. Fellows will receive dedicated support from the Simons Foundation endowment.

The start date for the position is August 17, 2026.
