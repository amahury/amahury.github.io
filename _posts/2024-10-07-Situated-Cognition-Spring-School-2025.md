### Abstract
This spring school of situated cognition brings together a diverse range of researchers working on mind and cognition, and how they relate to the body and environment. We strive to provide an extensive overview of state-of-the-art theorizing, experimenting, observing and surveying of all kinds of situated phenomena in humans, non-human animals and AI systems. The relevance and impact of these advancements is then also reflected upon for the scientific domain and beyond. We are therefore delighted to have a lineup of excellent keynotes coming from diverse backgrounds and with different interests ranging from, but are not limited to, philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, animal research, sociology, and artificial systems. Doctoral students and early postdocs from Europe or abroad are cordially invited to apply for a talk or poster presentation. We aim to provide an open and collaborative environment to foster intensive discussion, networking and exchange with leading experts as well as fellow students of this continuously growing area of research.

### Participation and Registration
Online participation is free and requires no registration, so feel welcome to join via the Zoom link we will share on this webpage below. However, if you would like to participate as a guest listener on-site, please send an email to Rebecca Watzlawek (rwatzlawek [at] uos DOT de) so that we can prepare the venue location accordingly.
Tuition is free given our funding as a DFG-funded Research Training Group located at Ruhr University Bochum and Osnabrück University.

### Call for Applications: Talks and Posters
We invite applications from PhD students and early post-doctoral researchers (PhD in 2020 or later) for presentation slots in our program or poster presentations. ﻿Any empirical or philosophical research on situated cognition and related areas is welcome. Projects with connections to the topics of the keynote talks are especially appreciated.

Accepted presenters who do not have their own institutional funding will receive support of up to 250 Euros for those based in Europe and 350 Euro for non-EU applicants (within a post-event reimbursement procedure based on submitted expenses; we can only recover costs for travelling and accommodation).

**Submission**

Applicants are asked to submit an abstract of their work (maximum 500 words) until November 15, 2024 on our SciencesCONF application website (down below). Our anonymous review results will reach you by mid-December, 2024.

During the application, you will be asked to indicate a preference whether you would like to give a talk or only present a poster. Applications which are not accepted as talks will also be evaluated for possible poster presentations. Also note that the author information will be requested via the application platform to contact you after the anonymous review process. Therefore, the abstract and any file uploaded should be anonymized with all identifying information removed to allow for a blind review. You can also submit work that is the result of collaborations. However, we will only accept one submission to be presented per speaker. The funding can also only be given to one speaker per talk.
