### General Info
Special Issue: Evaluating Artificial Consciousness

Special Issue Editors: Wanja Wiese, François Kammerer, and Christian de Weerd.

Manuscript Submission Deadline: January 15th 2026.

### Topics

We invite contributions that discuss the problem of artificial consciousness from metaphysical, epistemological, or ethical perspectives. Potential topics for submissions include, but are not limited to, the following:
- How can the science of consciousness contribute to evaluating the possibility of consciousness in artificial systems?
- Do certain metaphysical views (e.g., panpsychism) have distinct implications about the possibility of AI consciousness?
- To what extent can we remain neutral with respect to the hard problem when assessing the possibility of AI consciousness?
- How can we evaluate the strength of evidence for consciousness in artificial systems?
- How can we evaluate to what extent artificial systems have agency?
- How are consciousness and agency related to moral status in artificial systems?
- Specifically: what moral significance (if any) does phenomenal consciousness in artificial systems have?
- To what extent, and how, should considerations about AI welfare inform policy decisions?

### Submission Guideline
Full submissions are due on January 15th  2026. We accept submissions in different lengths, but we expect a majority of submissions to be between 4.000 and 8.000 words. Submissions should not exceed the maximum length of 10.000 words (including footnotes, excluding references, title, and abstract). Except for manuscript length, PhiMiSci’s usual author guidelines for author’s submissions apply. After an initial screening by the editors of the Special Issue, all relevant submissions will undergo double-blind peer review. 

If you’re uncertain whether your work fits this issue, we encourage you to make a presubmission inquiry (even ahead of writing a manuscript) to wanja.wiese@rub.de. Please attach an abstract. 

Deadlines and Schedule:
- Presubmission inquiries are welcome at any time.
- Manuscript Submission Period: August 11th 2025 - January 15th 2026.
- Estimated Publication Date: 1st quarter of 2027.
