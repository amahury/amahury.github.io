How do ideas, diseases, and information spread through our world? Network science helps us answer these questions by studying the structure and dynamics of complex systems, from human interactions and social media to biological and technological networks. This interdisciplinary field combines tools from physics, mathematics, computer science, neuroscience, and the social sciences to uncover the mechanisms behind spreading processes. These insights are key not only for understanding public health crises and viral information flows but also for guiding better decisions in policy, communication, advanced therapies, and technology. Our workshop will bring together researchers and students to explore the latest advances in modeling, analysis, and applications of spreading phenomena. Participants will engage with leading experts through invited talks, discussions, and hands-on presentations. Join us to connect with the growing community of scientists working at the frontier of complex systems, with applications ranging from neuroscience and biology to social dynamics and beyond.

Venue: The event will be held at IFT-UNESP, located at R. Jornalista Aloysio Biondi, 120 – Barra Funda, São Paulo. The easiest way to reach us is by subway or bus, See arrival instructions here.

Accommodation: Participants whose accommodation will be provided by the institute will stay at Hotel Intercity the Universe Paulista. Hotel recommendations are available here.

Attention! Some participants in ICTP-SAIFR activities have received email from fake travel agencies asking for credit card information. All communication with participants will be made by ICTP-SAIFR staff using an e-mail “@ictp-saifr.org”. We will not send any mailings about accommodation that require a credit card number or any sort of deposit. Also, if you are staying at Hotel Intercity the Universe Paulista, please confirm with the Uber/Taxi driver that the hotel is located at Rua Pamplona 83 in Bela Vista (and not in Jardim Etelvina).

Deadline: January 15, 2026
