BSD E&E - Administration

### About the Department
The Bettencourt Laboratory in the Department of Ecology and Evolution at The University of Chicago is seeking a Data Scientist Analyst.  In the Betterncourt Lab much of the research and service are presently dedicated to the scientific study of cities and associated practices to help make our societies more just and sustainable. The guiding vision is to approach cities with epistemic humility towards a complex and multi-faceted phenomenon involving the lives of billions of people, deserving to be appreciated and understood.  A number of recent discoveries show that cities are a natural phenomenon with predictable properties and dynamics and reveal associated processes of natural design. They explain how cities can naturally enable open-ended human collaboration and invention while improving access to basic services, education, health, and political participation. New forms of practice and policy are emerging from these insights, supporting human agency across scales, collaborative institutions, novel approaches to design, and new uses of technology for sustainability and human development.
