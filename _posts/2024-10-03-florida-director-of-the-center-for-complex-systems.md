### Position Summary:
We are seeking an experienced and visionary leader to serve as the Director of the Center for Complex Systems. The Center for Complex Systems (the Center) is a leading research center within the Charles E. Schmidt College of Science at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, Florida, dedicated to advancing the understanding of complex systems. Our members work on cutting-edge projects that span various domains including biology, neuroscience, medicine, physics, mathematics, psychology, philosophy, engineering, and social sciences. The Center is at the forefront of interdisciplinary research and is committed to fostering innovation and collaboration to solve some of the most challenging problems in science, technology, and society.

The Center was established in 1985 and has a robust legacy as a research and graduate instructional center. The overarching mission of the Center is to understand how complex phenomena, both natural and artificial, arise from the interaction of multiple components acting at many scales – an enterprise that transcends and eludes traditional disciplines.  Using the concepts of complexity science, the Center’s mission is to address problems that confront society at all levels by developing and implementing quantitative methods and tools (e.g. computational modeling, non-linear dynamical systems, AI and machine/deep learning, etc.) to analyze empirical data from multiple sources. Two key synergistic initiatives are central to the Center’s vision - one emphasizing the pedagogical value of the complexity science perspective and the other nurturing research collaborations among faculty.  To achieve these goals, faculty who are members of the Center are drawn from across the University’s colleges and departments and maintain collaborations, not only internally at FAU, but also with nationally and internationally renowned research institutions.  Faculty members of the Center have access to doctoral programs in many disciplines within the University, such as the PhD in Neurosciences (Theoretical and Computational Neuroscience Track), Integrative Biology, Experimental Psychology, Physics, Mathematics, and Engineering.  In addition, Center faculty have been instrumental in the development of an open resource lab – the Gruber AI Sandbox – that acts as a nexus for AI research at FAU by incorporating existing faculty research directions and encouraging students and faculty to participate in research focused on the interactions and co-development of human and machine learning.

### Position Overview:
The Director will be responsible for setting the strategic direction of the Center, overseeing research and instructional activities and fostering a collaborative environment that promotes excellence in complex systems research and instruction throughout the College and the University.  The successful candidate will ideally conduct research on the emergent behavior and theoretical/computational modeling of complex systems. This role involves developing theoretical frameworks, designing experiments, and utilizing computational tools to analyze and interpret data. A strong background in complex systems theory, mathematical modeling, computational methods and/or AI is desirable, alongside a motivation for applying complex systems approaches to a range of real-world problems in science, engineering and medicine. The director position will be an appointment at the (senior) associate or full professor level with tenure in one of the academic departments of the Schmidt College of Science and will serve as a member of the dean’s leadership team.

### Key Responsibilities:
Provide strategic leadership and vision for the Center for Complex Systems Oversee and coordinate interdisciplinary research projects within the Center Foster a collaborative and inclusive research environment Provide administrative oversight and serve as a member of the Gruber AI Sandbox Advisory Committee Secure funding through grants, partnerships, and other sources to support the Center’s activities Represent the Center at national and international conferences, workshops, and meetings Develop and maintain relationships with academic, industry and government partners to promote strategic research collaborations Mentor and support the professional development of faculty, researchers and students Ensure the dissemination of research findings through publications, presentations and other channels Manage the Center’s budget and resources effectively The Center for Complex Systems at Florida Atlantic University seeks scholars who are committed to supporting the learning needs of students from diverse backgrounds and to thoughtfully engaging all communities in higher education. Florida Atlantic University embodies a culture of strategic and collaborative community engagement that results in mutual benefit to the institution and the various internal and external communities that it serves.
