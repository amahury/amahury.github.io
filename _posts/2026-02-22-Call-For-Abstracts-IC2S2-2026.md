### About the Conference
The International Conference for Computational Social Science (IC2S2) will be hosted by the Vermont Complex Systems Institute at the University of Vermont in Burlington, Vermont from July 28-31, 2026. IC2S2 has emerged as the dominant conference at the intersection of social and computational science, bringing together researchers from around the world in sociology, economics, political science, psychology, cognitive science, management, computer science, statistics and the full range of natural and applied sciences committed to understanding the social world through large-scale data and computation. IC2S2 is the annual conference of the International Society for Computational Social Science.

The full-scale three-day conference (July 29-31) will feature research and researchers from around the world, across a broad range of relevant fields, and working on all areas of computational social science to advance its many frontiers. July 28 will be reserved for workshops and tutorials particularly targeted at early-career scholars.

The IC2S2 community actively balances and maintains a conversation between social and computational scientists which integrates technological advances and opportunities with social scientific rigor and insight.

### Call for Abstracts
The International Conference on Computational Social Science (IC2S2) is the premier conference bringing together researchers from different disciplines interested in using computational and data-intensive methods to address relevant societal problems. IC2S2 hosts academics and practitioners in computational science, social science, complexity, and network science, and provides a platform for new research in the field of computational social science.

Submissions are in the form of extended abstracts (max 2 pages) in PDF format, formatted according to the official LaTeX or MS Word templates that can be downloaded from the submission website. The submission should include a title, a list of 5 keywords, and an extended abstract (serving as the main text of the submission). The abstract should outline the impact of the work, along with (if relevant) the main theoretical contribution, data and methods used, and findings. Authors are strongly encouraged to include figures and/or tables in their submission (note that figures and/or tables will not count towards the page limit). Submitted abstracts will undergo a double-blind review process. Therefore, abstracts must be anonymized: do not include the author(s) names or affiliation(s) in the paper, and do not include funding or other acknowledgments. When submitting, authors will be also asked to provide a short summary paragraph that will be used during the review bidding phase. Submissions that violate these guidelines will be automatically rejected.

Submissions will be non-archival, and thus the presented work can be already published, in preparation for publication elsewhere, or ongoing research. Abstracts will be reviewed by multiple members of a Program Committee composed of experts in computational social science. The accepted contributions will be selected for one of the following presentations: (i) a lightning talk (~6 mins) in a plenary session, (ii) an oral presentation in parallel tracks (~15 mins), or (iii) a poster presentation session. Lightning talks will be preferentially assigned to those requesting this form of presentation at submission and to early career researchers. In order to be included in the program, at least one of the authors must register for the conference by the early-bird registration deadline.

We welcome submissions on any topic in the field of computational social science, including (a) work that advances methods and approaches for computational social science, (b) data-driven work that describes and discovers social and cultural phenomena or explains and estimates relations between them and other things, and (c) theoretical work that generates new insights, connections and frameworks for computational social science research. Researchers across disciplines, faculty, graduate students, industry researchers, policy makers, and nonprofit workers are all encouraged to submit computational data-driven research and innovative computational methodological or theoretical contributions on social phenomena for consideration. Topics include but are not limited to:
- Network analysis of social systems
- Large-scale social experiments
- Empirically calibrated simulation models
- Large language models for social research
- Text analysis and natural language processing (NLP) of social phenomena
- Analysis of meaning through computational analysis of text, images, audio, video, etc.
- Computational methods to map and study cultural patterns and dynamics
- Agent-based or other simulation of social phenomena
- Methods and issues of social data collection
- Images as social data
- Causal inference and machine learning
- Methods and analyses of biased, selective, or incomplete observational social dataIntegration and triangulation of multi-modal social and cultural data
- Methods and analyses for social information / digital communication dynamics
- Neural network methods for social analysis and policy exploration
- Reproducibility in computational social science research
- Theoretical discussions/concepts in computational social scienceEthics of computational research on human behavior
- Issues of inclusivity in computational social scienceMethods and analyses of algorithmic accountability and trustworthiness
- Novel digital data and/or computational analyses for addressing societal challenges
- Social news curation and collaborative filtering
- Building and evaluating socio-technical systems
- Methods and analyses of integrated human-machine decision-making
- Science and technology studies approaches to computational science work
