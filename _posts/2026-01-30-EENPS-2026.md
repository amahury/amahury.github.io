### Funding
NEC's involvement in the organization of the conference is supported by a grant of the Romanian Ministry of Research, Innovation and Digitization, CNCS/CCCDI – UEFISCDI, project number PN-IV-P8-8.1-PRE-HE-ORG-2023-0055, within PNCDI IV.

There are no registration fees to attend or to present at the conference. This is made possible by the generous support of the Faculty of Philosophy, University of Bucharest and New Europe College. If your abstract got accepted for presentation, we ask you not to cancel your presentation unless it is an emergency, as this creates additional work to our volunteer organisers.
