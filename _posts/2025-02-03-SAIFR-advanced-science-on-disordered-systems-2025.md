### General info
Disorder plays a central role in the theoretical description of a rich variety of systems spanning several disciplines — soft and hard condensed matter, biology, information science and engineering. Today, there is a surplus of enthusiastic and capable students with a diverse background who are eager to receive systematic training on powerful theoretical methods and exciting recent developments in the field. One of the goals of our school is to reach a broad audience that includes students interested in complexity or bio-inspired applications, as well as information science and quantum materials. Our school will establish a common forum where theories of general interest can be learned and discussed, catalyze the nucleation of new research lines in São Paulo and Brazil, and expose students to a full breadth of intellectual opportunity in the field of disordered systems.

_As a São Paulo School of Advanced Science, funds are available for travel and local expenses of Master’s and PhD students from not only South America but also from other continents.As a São Paulo School of Advanced Science, funds are available for travel and local expenses of Master’s and PhD students from not only South America but also from other continents._
