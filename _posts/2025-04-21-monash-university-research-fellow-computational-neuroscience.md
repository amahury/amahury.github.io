### The Opportunity
Unlock the mysteries of the brain. Join a pioneering team at the forefront of neuroimaging and computational neuroscience.

We are seeking an exceptional early-career researcher to join a multidisciplinary team as a Research Fellow in Systems and Computational Neuroscience. This exciting opportunity is perfect for someone passionate about applying advanced imaging and computational tools to tackle some of the most complex questions in brain science.

As a Level A research-only academic, you will contribute to projects that integrate computational models with experimental neuroimaging data to better understand the structure and function of the brain—across health, disease, and species. You'll work with world-class researchers in fields including network science, biophysical modelling, neuroimaging, genetics, and comparative neuroscience.

This role offers a platform to build your research profile, collaborate across disciplines, co-supervise students, and contribute to high-impact discoveries.

### Key Responsibilities
- Conduct independent and collaborative research in systems and computational neuroscience
- Integrate and analyse multimodal data using advanced modelling and programming techniques
- Contribute to peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations, and research reports
- Support and mentor research staff and students
- Participate in the development of funding applications and ethics submissions
- Attend team meetings, seminars, and relevant departmental activities
- Assist in experimental design and use of advanced technical equipment

### About You
We’re looking for a motivated and technically skilled researcher who brings:
- A PhD in Computational Neuroscience, Physics, Engineering, Computer Science, Psychology, or a related discipline
- Strong quantitative and programming skills (preferably MATLAB, Python, and/or C++)
- A strong track record of research output, including journal publications and conference contributions
- Expertise or strong interest in one or more of the following areas:
  - Computational modelling of neural systems
  - Bioinformatics
  - Imaging genetics
  - Neuroimaging techniques (MRI, MEG, EEG)
  - Comparative or cross-species neuroscience
- Excellent problem-solving, organisational, and communication skills
- A collaborative approach and enthusiasm for interdisciplinary work
- Experience working with large-scale neuroscience data is desirable
