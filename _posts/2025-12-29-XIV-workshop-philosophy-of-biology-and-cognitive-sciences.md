### General Info
The Research Workshop on Philosophy of Biology and Cognitive Sciences (PBCS) is an encounter of young scholars that aims at bringing together researchers from different disciplinary backgrounds: philosophers, biologists, cognitive scientists working on issues of common interest. 

This workshop is a place where young researchers can present their ideas and participate in the discussions, as well as attend the conferences of keynote speakers. Its main purposes are to serve as a tool for enhancing research through discussion and to promote the sharing of the ideas presented in an interdisciplinary context. 

In its fourteenth edition, the organisers would like to keep encouraging young researchers to participate in this fresh and distinctive forum.

### Call For Abstracts
Young researchers (Master’s and PhD students, as well as scholars who defended their PhD dissertations within the last three years) are encouraged to submit their work, present their ideas, and participate in vibrant interdisciplinary discussions. Women and other underrepresented groups are especially encouraged to apply. Possible topics include (but are not limited to):
- Enactive and 4E approaches to cognition, perception, and mental disorders
- Embodied intersubjectivity and affective dynamics in psychotherapy and social cognition
- Phenomenology and qualitative methods in cognitive science and mental health research
- Philosophical foundations of psychiatry and models of mental disorders
- Organism-environment relations in biological explanation and cognitive science
- Theoretical and conceptual perspectives on comparative biology and evolutionary theory
- Historical and philosophical analyses of the organism in contemporary biosciences
- Measurement, modeling, and data practices in the life and cognitive sciences
- Mathematical formalization and normativity in biological and psychological explanation
- Big data, AI, and methodological innovation in biology and cognitive science

### Submission Guidelines
We invite abstracts between 500 and 750 words. Applicants must send a detailed summary of the contribution to the email address by 15 January. Summaries must be sent in PDF format. The contributions are expected to indicate the title of the talk and also highlight the relevance of the topic for the event and a sketch of the main arguments.

The second one will not include names, affiliations, email contact or any kind of information that could reveal the authorship of the document. Contributions will be sent to a specialised scientific committee for evaluation. The organising committee is committed to ensuring a double-blind peer review process.
