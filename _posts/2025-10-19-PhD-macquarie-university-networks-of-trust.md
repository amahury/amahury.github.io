### The Project
This current project will characterise the traits that make people resilient or vulnerable to unwarranted conspiracy theories, misinformation, disinformation, and slopaganda, as well as the structures of networks of trust and distrust that exacerbate or mitigate the manifestation of these traits.

Combining empirical data collection with philosophical theorising and computerised simulations of large, real-world network structures, the project represents a significant advance in developing potential interventions upon existing epistemic networks. I will:
- analyse epistemic virtues (eg curiosity, openmindedness, intellectual humility) and vices (eg closedmindedness, epistemic insouciance, epistemic arrogance)
- evaluate features of the environment as protective or risk factors that make people especially likely to accept or reject authoritative testimony, unwarranted conspiracy theories, misinformation and disinformation.

While research in risk communications and media studies has addressed these topics from other perspectives, it has done so without taking account of the rich philosophical literature on both virtue epistemology and social epistemology.

From these two angles – the individual and the network – my project addresses two sub-questions:
- Given the topology of the networks of trust and distrust in which people and artificial agents are located, what sorts of epistemic traits should the people cultivate and avoid, and what sorts of patterns in the artificial agents should be inculcated or eradicated?
- Given people’s actual epistemic traits, which network structures are more likely to promote or obstruct good epistemic outcomes at the individual and social levels?

### About the scholarship
The project is structured as a staged, three-pronged effort, and the PhD is expected to choose one of them on which to focus. This scholarship is intended to benefit a researcher in empirically-oriented philosophy. The PhD will engage in a philosophical reflection, empirical research using natural language, and epistemic network simulations.

### Availability
This scholarship is available to eligible candidates to undertake a four-year MRes and PhD program.

### Components
The scholarship comprises:
- a tuition fee offset/scholarship
- a living allowance stipend

The value of each stipend scholarship is $39,700 per annum (full time, indexed) for four years.
