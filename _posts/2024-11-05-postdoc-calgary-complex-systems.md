### General info
The Complexity Science Group in the Department of Physics & Astronomy at the University of Calgary invites applications for a Postdoctoral Scholar in the fields of statistical physics, complex networks and nonlinear dynamics. The successful applicant is expected to work closely with a multidisciplinary research team led by Dr. Jörn Davidsen on problems related to neuroscience and/or geoscience. Specific topics of interest include but are not limited to chimera behavior in neuronal systems, the critical brain hypothesis, network inference and network neuroscience as well as statistical seismology, earthquake triggering, induced seismicity, rock fracture and frictional sliding. Successful candidates are expected to primarily conduct theoretical and computational research taking advantage of our international network of experimental collaborators and/or clinical partners. More information about the Complexity Science Group and current research is available at www.ucalgary.ca/complexity/davidsen.

### Requirements and benefits
Candidates should have received or will soon receive a PhD in theoretical physics or a related discipline. A strong background in statistical physics, network science, nonlinear dynamics, computational physics, statistical seismology, fracture processes or computational neurosciences is required. Solid data analysis and programming skills are beneficial. Possible start dates are between January 1, 2025 and June 1, 2025. The start date has to be within five years of being awarded a PhD degree. The position is for two years and includes an annual stipend of $54,000 plus benefits.

### Application
Applicants should submit their application package including a cover letter, CV with a list of publications, brief statement of research interests and their possible start dates in PDF format to davidsen@phas.ucalgary.ca. Applicants should arrange for at least two letters of reference to be sent as well. Review of applications will begin December 15, 2024 and continue until the position is filled. For additional information and informal inquiries, please contact Dr. Jörn Davidsen at davidsen@phas.ucalgary.ca. We strive for a diverse and inclusive environment and encourage applications from members of any identity.
