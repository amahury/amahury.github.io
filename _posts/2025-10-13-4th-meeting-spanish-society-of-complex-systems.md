The Spanish Society of Complex Systems (CS³ Spain) was founded in 2022, during the International Conference on Complex Systems held in Palma de Mallorca, with the aim of strengthening the community of complex systems researchers in our country.

Since then, the Spanish Chapter has held three meetings: in Santander (2023), in Barcelona (2024) and in Madrid (2025), consolidating itself as a reference space for the exchange of ideas and interdisciplinary collaboration.

The 4th Meeting of the Spanish Society for Complex Systems will take place in Seville, from January 21 to 23, 2026, at the iconic Uruguay Pavilion, headquarters of the University of Seville. The format is a two-day workshop, starting on Wednesday, January 21 at 3:30 p.m. and ending on Friday, January 23 at 2:00 p.m. There will be invited talks and several contributed talks (15 or 20 minutes), as well as a poster session.

### Location
The meeting will take place in the Uruguayan Pavilion at the 1929 Ibero-American Exposition in Seville, conveniently located in the city center.

Address: Av. de Chile, s/n, Old Town, 41013 Seville

### Call For Contributions
To participate in the 4th CS³ Meeting, you must submit an abstract in PDF format. The LaTeX template available here is recommended , although abstracts prepared using other tools will also be accepted, provided the final file is submitted in PDF format.

The deadline for submissions is October 30, 2025, at 11:59 PM (Spanish time). This deadline is strict and will not be extended to ensure the proper organization of the scientific program and the timely opening of participant registration.

### Registration
As a participant, you will have full access to all conferences, talks, posters, and meeting activities. You will also be able to join the Complex Systems Society Spain community, with the opportunity to become a member for free and actively participate in the development of the Spanish chapter.
