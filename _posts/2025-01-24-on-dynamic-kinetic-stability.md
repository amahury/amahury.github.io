description: Dynamic Kinetic Stability, a type of stability found in chemical systems that are not in equilibrium and are constantly fed by energy, has not received sufficient attention in the current literature related to the origin of life. Here I briefly review that concept, pointing out its potential and parallels with other ideas in the knowledge market.

[Dynamic Kinetic Stability](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-642-27833-4_5612-1) (DKS) represents a groundbreaking conceptual advancement in understanding the persistence and evolution of living systems. Grounded in the kinetic principles of chemical reactions, DKS bridges the historical divide between classical thermodynamics and the dynamic nature of life. By tracing its intellectual lineage and situating it within the broader scientific context, we explore the origins, development, and implications of DKS as a transformative paradigm in theoretical biology.

### Historical Roots
The concept of stability has deep roots in science, dating back to the 19th-century development of thermodynamics. Pioneers like [Rudolf Clausius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Clausius) and [Ludwig Boltzmann](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Boltzmann) formulated the [second law of thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics), which established a probabilistic framework for understanding the directionality of natural processes. This framework introduced the concept of [thermodynamic stability](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/thermodynamic-stability), where systems progress toward states of lower energy and higher entropy.

Applying thermodynamic principles to living systems, however, revealed a paradox. Biological entities, inherently [far from equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-equilibrium_thermodynamics), maintain their organized structures despite the second law’s directive toward disorder. [Erwin Schrödinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Schr%C3%B6dinger) addressed this paradox in his 1944 book [_What is Life?_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Is_Life%3F), proposing that living systems sustain their organization by extracting "negative entropy" ([negentropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negentropy)) from their environments. Schrödinger’s insights inspired generations of scientists to reconcile the laws of physics with the apparent purposiveness of life.

The mid-20th century ushered in the molecular biology revolution, exemplified by Watson and Crick’s 1953 [discovery](https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/discovery-of-dna-structure-and-function-watson-397/) of the DNA double helix. While this discovery illuminated the molecular mechanisms of heredity and replication, questions about life’s persistence and evolutionary dynamics persisted. How could Darwinian principles of [natural selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection) harmonize with the deterministic laws of physics and chemistry?

### A Kinetic Perspective
Amid these questions, theoretical chemists and biologists began exploring the interplay between kinetics and thermodynamics. [Alfred Lotka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_J._Lotka) and [Ilya Prigogine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Prigogine) played pivotal roles in this shift, emphasizing nonequilibrium processes and dissipative structures—systems that sustain themselves through continuous energy flow. Prigogine’s groundbreaking work, recognized with a Nobel Prize in [1977](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/1977/prigogine/facts/), demonstrated that far-from-equilibrium conditions could produce ordered structures, providing a thermodynamic framework for understanding life’s complexity.

Building on these foundations, [Addy Pross](https://www.thethirdwayofevolution.com/people/view/addy-pross) and colleagues formalized the concept of DKS in the early 21st century. Pross argued that traditional thermodynamic stability, which emphasizes static energy minima, is insufficient to explain the persistence of replicative systems. He proposed that life’s stability is inherently kinetic, driven by replication and turnover. This reframing allowed Darwinian concepts like fitness and selection to be integrated into a kinetic framework, uniting biology and chemistry under a cohesive theoretical model.

DKS did not emerge in isolation. Stuart Kauffman’s [research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocatalytic_set) on self-organization and complex systems highlighted how simple rules could produce emergent properties in biological networks. Similarly, Manfred Eigen’s [concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercycle_(chemistry)) of hypercycles provided a mathematical model for cooperative behavior among replicative molecules, advancing our understanding of prebiotic evolution. These complementary theories aimed to bridge the gap between the physical sciences and the unique characteristics of life, underscoring the dual aspects of stability: persistence over time and energy-driven dynamics.

All these theories shared a common goal: to bridge the gap between the physical sciences and the unique characteristics of life. [The persistence principle](https://sci-hub.ru/10.1039/C5CC06260H), central to DKS, echoes Lotka’s idea of "[persistence of stable forms](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/evolution-from-the-standpoint-of-physics-i/)" and [Richard Dawkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dawkins)’ reinterpretation of Darwinian evolution as "[survival of the most stable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Selfish_Gene)". Together, these ideas reflect a growing recognition of stability’s dual facets: time (persistence) and energy (thermodynamics).

### Towards a Unify Framework
DKS represents more than a theoretical model; it signifies a paradigm shift in how we understand life’s relationship with the physical world. By incorporating kinetic factors into the concept of stability, DKS reconciles the probabilistic nature of thermodynamics with the directed evolution of replicative systems. This synthesis not only enriches our understanding of life’s origins but also positions DKS as a cornerstone for [investigating](https://sci-hub.ru/10.1039/C5CC06260H) dynamic systems in physics, chemistry, and biology.

DKS offers insights into the transition from non-living to living matter. Early replicative systems, such as [RNA-world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_world) molecules, likely achieved persistence through kinetic stability rather than thermodynamic favorability. This perspective resolves long-standing paradoxes about life’s origins, including the apparent contradiction between the second law of thermodynamics and the emergence of complex, ordered systems.

Moreover, DKS provides a unifying lens for examining biological complexity. The hierarchical organization of life—from molecular assemblies to ecosystems—can be viewed as nested DKS systems. Each level reflects a dynamic equilibrium sustained by replication and turnover, illustrating principles of kinetic selection. This [framework](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-1729/12/12/2016) also sheds light on emergent properties like cognition and agency, suggesting they arise naturally from the dynamics of DKS systems.

### Conclusion
Dynamic Kinetic Stability represents an exciting frontier in theoretical biology. By contextualizing life’s persistence and evolution within a kinetic framework, it bridges long-standing gaps between biology, chemistry, and physics. While the full implications of DKS are yet to be explored, this approach holds immense potential for deepening our understanding of life’s origins, complexity, and adaptive strategies. Expanding this framework invites interdisciplinary collaboration, offering a promising pathway for unraveling the intricacies of life and its remarkable resilience.
