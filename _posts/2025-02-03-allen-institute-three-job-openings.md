### Opportunity 1: Technical Project Manager III – Engineering Department
We are seeking a Technical Project Manager to join the Scientific Instrumentation and Process engineering (SIPE) team where our remit is to design, build/implement and maintain reliable high-performance instruments, tools, and processes for pipeline data generation projects. We must coordinate the operation of multiple pieces of scientific instrumentation, encapsulate the complex experimental procedures into easy-to-use software applications and ensure the repeatable acquisition of (petabyte scale) data.

Projects are numerous and as a result, the project portfolio is large; the team seeks efficiency using common processes, design paradigms, and robust infrastructure. In keeping with our mission, we facilitate the work of others and participate in open-source software initiatives. The Technical Project Manager will play a critical role in improving efficiency and maximizing the impact of both hardware and software engineering projects, ensuring alignment with the institute’s priorities. This individual will oversee project intake, definition, resource management, and execution for initiatives requested by our scientific teams and leadership. They will manage a project backlog, provide regular status updates, and ensure the smooth progression of active projects. Success in this role requires the ability to multitask and prioritize in a fast-paced environment, while effectively translating technical information for non-technical audiences and vice versa.

#### Required Education and Experience
- Bachelor’s degree in mechanical/electrical/computer engineering or relevant scientific field, or project management; or equivalent combination of degree and experience
- 3 years’ experience in software engineering, systems engineering, hardware engineering, or technical product/program management experience
- Proficient in project management tools (e.g., GitHub, JIRA, Confluence, Smartsheet, Miro) and Microsoft Office

#### Benefits
Employees (and their families) are eligible to enroll in benefits per eligibility rules outlined in the Allen Institute’s Benefits Guide. These benefits include medical, dental, vision, and basic life insurance. Employees are also eligible to enroll in the Allen Institute’s 401k plan. Paid time off is also available as outlined in the Allen Institutes Benefits Guide. Details on the Allen Institute’s benefits offering are located at the following link to the Benefits Guide: https://alleninstitute.org/careers/benefits.

### Opportunity 2: Research Associate I - Molecular Anatomy Department
We are seeking a Research Associate to contribute to efforts to engineer antibodies and other protein-binding proteins for tissue labeling. In recent years, there have been rapid advances in spatial transcriptomics (i.e. imaging of mRNA) but efforts to localize proteins have lagged far behind. By adopting and optimizing state-of-the-art expansion microscopy techniques, our team will systematically catalog the subcellular distribution of all proteins in the brain – including uncharacterized and disease-related gene products. Experimental approaches and responsibilities will involve mammalian and bacterial protein production, protein purification, and bioconjugation. The goal is to develop a panel of reagents that will enable highly multiplexed protein detection. Ideal candidates will have a background in biological sciences with the temperament to work collaboratively in a fast-paced team environment and will receive training in all relevant techniques.

#### Required Education and Experience 
- Bachelor's degree in Biology, Chemistry, Neuroscience, or related discipline
- Experience with the preparation of laboratory reagents, buffers, and aliquots
- Familiarity with biochemical techniques

### Opportunity 3: Research Associate I - Molecular Anatomy Department
We are seeking a Research Associate to contribute to the team effort to conduct CRISPR screening in vivo. In recent years, there have been rapid advances in spatial transcriptomics (i.e. imaging of mRNA) but efforts to localize proteins have lagged far behind. By adopting and optimizing state-of-the-art CRISPR editing techniques, our team will systematically catalog the subcellular distribution of all proteins in the brain – including uncharacterized and disease-related gene products. This position will leverage state-of-the-art imaging methods to perform in situ transcriptomics profiling (including but not limited to BARseq, MERFISH, and HCR) of brain tissue. The goal is to develop a robust method for performing in situ sequencing in brain tissue. Ideal candidates will have a background in molecular biology and microscopy with the temperament to work collaboratively in a fast-paced team environment and will receive training in all relevant techniques.

#### Required Education and Experience 
- Bachelor's degree in Biology, Chemistry, Neuroscience, or related discipline
- Strong foundation in biochemistry and molecular biology
- Experience with the operation of research-grade microscopy instrumentation
