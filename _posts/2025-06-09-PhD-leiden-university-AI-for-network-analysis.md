### About this position
We are looking for a motivated and talented early-career researcher with a strong interest in social network analysis, complex networks, or network science, and relevant background knowledge on methods in machine learning and AI. The successful candidate will focus on innovating the field of network analysis with AI methods. Examples of topics include algorithmic fairness in network analysis, developing network embedding frameworks for real-world network datasets or AI models based on agentic LLMs for simulating real-world network data. The candidate is furthermore encouraged to propose their own research direction related to AI methods for advancing network analysis.

### We are looking for
An excellent young scientist with a master’s degree or equivalent in computer science, data science, AI, computational social science, or a related field. You have a keen interest in algorithms, ML, and AI, well-developed skill set in (scientific) programming, and an affinity with network analysis in particular. You are able to work with very large data and have the creativity and curiosity to develop AI models for network analysis. The ideal candidate has a critical, open-minded, and collaborative spirit; is creative, precise, and does not shy back from entering new scholarly terrain at the cutting edge of network science and AI.

You will be part of the Computational Network Science (CNS) research group (see https://cns.liacs.nl) of LIACS, the computer science and AI department of the Faculty of Science at Leiden University. The candidate will be encouraged to collaborate on projects with other members of the group, which has access to a large number of relevant open and proprietary network datasets and a wide range of expertise, both in applied and fundamental network science research areas. Moreover, there are ample opportunities to collaborate with other research groups at LIACS, for example, data science, text mining, and algorithms. LIACS has an active PhD community that organizes seminars and social events specifically for PhD students. Additionally, there are plenty of opportunities for interaction and academic collaboration with other researchers in network science. For example, faculty-wide through the Leiden Complex Networks Network (LCN2, https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/science/lcn2) and nationally through, for example, the Dutch Network Science Society (https://www.netsci.nl).

### What will you be doing as a PhD Candidate?
- Conducting research at the intersection of AI and network science, leading to peer-reviewed publications;
- Writing an article-based PhD thesis within the duration of the position;
- Involvement in co-supervising a limited number of BSc and MSc students;
- Presenting research at international conferences;
- Being an active member of the CNS research group and taking up minor local organizational activities;
- Engaging in a limited number of teaching activities;

### Selection criteria
- A master’s degree* in a relevant field (e.g., computer science, AI, Data Science), ideally with experience in network science (c
- omplex networks/social network analysis) and AI;
- Experience with programming in languages relevant to designing AI models and social network analysis, at least including Python;Excellent writing skills and proficiency of the English language;
- Able to work independently and in a team;
- An academic, creative and curious mindset;

*Candidates not (yet) past the master’s phase are also invited to apply, assuming they will graduate in Summer 2025.

### Our organisation
The Faculty of Science is a world-class faculty where staff and students work together in a dynamic international environment. It is a faculty where personal and academic development are top priorities. Our people are committed to expanding fundamental knowledge by curiosity and to looking beyond the borders of their own discipline; their aim is to benefit science, and to make a contribution to addressing the major societal challenges of the future. The research carried out at the Faculty of Science is very diverse, ranging from mathematics, information science, astronomy, physics, chemistry and bio-pharmaceutical sciences to biology and environmental sciences. The research activities are organised in eight institutes. These institutes offer eight bachelor’s and twelve master's programmes. The faculty has grown strongly in recent years and now has more than 2.300 staff and almost 5,000 students. We are located at the heart of Leiden’s Bio Science Park, one of Europe’s biggest science parks, where university and business life come together.
