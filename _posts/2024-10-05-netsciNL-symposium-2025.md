Networks permeate every facet of modern life. Network science aims at understanding real-world systems across various domains, including biology, sociology, technology, and economics. Analysing patterns and interactions within networks provides insight into predicting behaviours, optimizing performance, and managing risks. Network science deepens our comprehension of interconnected systems, and drives innovations that address real-world challenges.
