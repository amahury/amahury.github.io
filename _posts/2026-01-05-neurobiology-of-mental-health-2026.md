"The Neurobiology of Mental Health" will be a 3.5-day discussion forum covering a broad range of emerging topics and views, with a focus on relevant mechanisms at the level of genes, cell types, organoids, circuits, networks and brain systems. The scientific program will include about 30 talks by invited speakers, about 15 short talks selected from participant abstracts, and two poster sessions. "The Neurobiology of Mental Health" will address across-levels research, from human to animal models (and back), focusing on genes and gene networks that influence mental health, effective drugs and their mechanisms of action, the role of developmental processes, the interface between cognition and mental health, the roles of neuroimmune and brain-gut mechanisms, as well as progress in the development of therapeutic brain and circuit stimulation procedures.
