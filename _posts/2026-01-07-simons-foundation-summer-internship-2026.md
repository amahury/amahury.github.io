description: The Simons Foundation's mission is to advance the frontiers of research in mathematics and the basic sciences. The foundation's support of science takes two forms. We support research by making grants to individual investigators and their projects through academic institutions, and, with the launch of the Flatiron Institute in 2016, we now conduct scientific research in-house, supporting teams of top computational scientists.

### Why Intern at the Simons Foundation?
- Work on Exciting Projects: You’ll collaborate with your mentor on a project that aligns with your field of study and builds your portfolio.
- Be Matched With a Mentor: You’ll be paired with an experienced scientist or supervisor who will guide your research or projects and help you to navigate the field.
- Collaborate With Top Scientists: Interns working on research projects will work with and learn from interdisciplinary scientists in a collaborative environment. Some research may lead to lasting collaborations.
- Attend Social Events: In addition to building your research and professional skills, you’ll have multiple opportunities to network with staff and peer interns through social events woven throughout your internship experience. Potential events include field trips to New York City museums, rooftop receptions and staff outings.
- Live and Work in New York City: All internships will be in person at our Manhattan offices. Interns may be provided with housing support near the Simons Foundation offices.
- Join a Vibrant Scientific Community: The Simons Foundation offers a wide variety of lectures, seminars and workshops, including coding workshops, scientific seminars and poster session workshops. Led by subject matter experts from around the world, these events will immerse you in the latest developments in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.

### Research Assistants and Research Associates
Research assistants are undergraduate students who come to the Flatiron Institute to work on a specifically designed project with a mentor within the center to which they are applying. Research associates are either graduate students or first or second-year pre-doctoral students who work on a specifically designed project with a mentor. Research assistant and research associate positions are offered with the following teams:
- Center for Computational Biology (CCB)
- Center for Computational Mathematics (CCM)
- Center for Computational Neuroscience (CCN)
- Center for Computational Quantum Physics (CCQ)
- Initiative for Computational Catalysis (ICC)
- Polymathic AI, Building Foundation Models for Science (AI/Machine Learning)
- Cosmic Microwave Background Analysis and Simulation (CMBAS)

Internships with the Center for Computational Astrophysics (CCA) are offered through participation in the Simons-NSBP Scholars and AstroCom NYC programs.

These internships typically last 11 weeks. To be eligible, interns must be enrolled in a degree-seeking program (undergraduate or higher). Applications open on December 1, 2025. Application deadline is January 16, 2026.
