### About
Three annual postdoctoral fellowship programs that support outstanding scientists at the Beckman Institute offer a unique opportunity for selected scholars to engage in a three-year fellowship of interdisciplinary research at the Beckman Institute.

The Beckman Institute Postdoctoral Fellows Program recruits up to six outstanding scientists annually to work at the Beckman Institute. The program was established in 1991 by the Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation.

The Beckman-Brown Interdisciplinary Postdoctoral Fellows Program selects one outstanding researcher annually. The program was initiated in the fall of 2015, when the Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation provided an endowment in honor of Dr. and Mrs. Arnold Beckman and the founding director of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, Dr. Theodore “Ted” Brown.

The Cancer Center at Illinois – Beckman Institute Postdoctoral Fellows Program supports up to three fellows who would like to pursue projects bridging basic cancer sciences and engineering. Fellows work with faculty mentors from CCIL and the Beckman Institute to develop transdisciplinary skills that support their career development.

Fellows are selected in accordance with the core values of the Beckman Institute: Excellence, Collaboration, Integrity, Transdisciplinarity, Exploration and Diversity.
