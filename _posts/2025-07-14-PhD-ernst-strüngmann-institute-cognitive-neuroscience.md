### What we offer
A fully funded 3-year PhD–position in cognitive neuroscience is available in our Max Planck research group – located at the Ernst Strüngmann Institute in Frankfurt, Germany. The ideal start date is soon: Summer or early fall 2025. The first applications will be reviewed on 28.07.25. 

We offer a collaborative environment to study the intersection between perception, cognition, and action in the brain. One particular focus is on the mechanisms of visual working memory, but we have many interests beyond this. 

We have access to research dedicated (high-field) fMRI, MEG, EEG, and computational resources. 

Besides ample resources, we offer a strong network of international collaborators, and the opportunity to work on cutting edge questions and techniques. 

### What we ask
We are looking for smart & enthusiastic people with a deep curiosity about the brain. People who enjoy digging into the nitty-gritty of detailed problems; who love to seek answers to Really Big Questions; who thrive in a collaborative and international setting; who are okay with the occasional failures inherent to science. 

We do not require entry tests (like the GRE), but do require strong computational skills, critical thinking, and an eye for detail. 

A proven track record showing your interest in neuroscience and computational methods is a big plus. An MSc degree in a related field, and considerable programming experience (e.g., Python, Matlab, or R) is required. Experience with neuroimaging (e.g. MEG or fMRI) is preferred. 

Finally, we ask you not to use AI generated texts in your application. Such texts provide little to no insight into your suitability for the position, and can therefore not be properly evaluated. 

### Application
To apply, email the following information:
1. Research statement describing the neuroscience research questions you have worked on in the past, and outstanding questions you would like to address in the future (max 1 page, double spaced).
2. Recent CV including (if applicable) a list of publications, computational competencies, and other relevant experience.
3. The names, email addresses, & affiliations of 3 references.
4. Most recent transcript of your grades including a legend to interpret the scale.
5. (optional) Statement of purpose describing what drives and motivates your passion for neuroscience research. Feel free to take this opportunity to discuss both the ups and downs of your path into scientific research or any perceived shortcomings in your application (max 1 page, double spaced).

**Position remains open until filled.**
