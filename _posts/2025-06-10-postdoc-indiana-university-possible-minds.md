### Position Details
- Appointment Status: Non-Tenure Track
- Department: IU Bloomington Arts & Sciences; Dean
- Location: Bloomington
- Position Summary:

The Center for Possible Minds at Indiana University, Bloomington, invites applications for Postdoctoral Fellows to join its Program for Advanced Research in Diverse Intelligences. The fellowship provides support to scholars studying intelligence/cognition/mind in diverse forms, from diverse disciplinary perspectives. Candidates must embrace interdisciplinary scholarship and be excited about substantial conversation and collaboration with other disciplines.

This postdoctoral fellowship program aims to create a cohort of researchers optimally positioned to address questions about the nature of biological, artificial, and collective intelligence through collaboration across a wide range of fields. We seek enthusiastic scientists and scholars who will embrace the chance to help set the agenda for our new research center. Postdoctoral fellows will have the opportunity to organize meetings and workshops at the Center as well as to propose new Center initiatives. We expect to hire 2-4 postdocs through this fellowship program. Postdocs will have offices in the Center for Possible Minds, where they will be joined by visiting fellows and faculty.

Fellows are expected to pursue research activities associated with their primary area(s) of scholarship, as well as to explore collaborative, interdisciplinary projects. These fellowships are designed to advance the careers of new scholars by providing opportunities to research, organize, and collaborate in a highly interdisciplinary environment. Strong applicants will demonstrate evidence of the sort of outstanding scholarly potential that would make them competitive for tenure-track faculty positions at Indiana University or other top research universities.

### Terms of Agreement
Fellows are expected to pursue research, organize workshops and events, and participate in Center activities and seminars. Fellowships are expected to be 2-year positions; fellows will be appointed as one-year contracts with the possibility for renewal. The start date is flexible; positions can begin as soon as August 1, 2025. Fellows will receive a salary of $60,000 plus health benefits and $3,000 each year in research support.
