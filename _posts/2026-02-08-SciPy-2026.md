description: Celebrate the 25th SciPy in Minneapolis, July 13-19, 2026 at the University of Minnesota. While we are excited about SciPy in Minneapolis this year, we are also aware of the evolving impact that ICE and the DHS is having in the Twin Cities. We are closely monitoring what is happening and are making plans to support our community’s safety and security.

### General Info
SciPy 2026 is the 25th annual Scientific Computing with Python conference, scheduled for July 13–19, 2026, at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. The event brings together researchers, developers, and industry professionals to showcase, learn, and collaborate on open-source Python tools for science, engineering, and data-driven discovery.

- Tutorials: July 13-14
- Conference: July 15-17
- Sprints: July 18-19

### Location
McNamara Alumni Center. 200 Oak Street S.E., Minneapolis, MN 55455.

### Call for Proposals
The call for proposals is Open. The deadline to submit a proposal is February 25, 2026. This year we are happy to announce two highlighted tracks that run in parallel with the general conference tracks:  

1. Spirit of SciPy: 25 years ago, the first SciPy conference convened scientists eager to work together to solve open problems with Python. As the community and conference have grown, the spirit of this first meeting remains central to SciPy. This highlighted track celebrates our ongoing commitment to open-source software and the ethos of collaborative learning, sharing and discovery. We invite submissions that showcase stories of ground-up collaborations, interdisciplinary uses or unconventional repurposing of domain-specific tools, and projects and organizations that trace their roots to SciPy itself.
2. Data-Driven Discovery, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence: This track aims to bring together the latest advances in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) and areas of data-driven insights that focus on advancing novel discovery across fields and applications in science and industry. This includes the development and application of new and existing open-source tools and techniques that have been influential in advancing scientific progress. We encourage submissions that include stories of applications and improvements to simulation and simulation-based inference.

Conference Tracks:
- Physics and Astronomy
- Environmental, Earth, and Climate Sciences
- Maintainers and Community
- Biological and Medical Sciences
- Scientific Computing in Education
- General

### SciPy 2026 Proposal Writing Office Hours
To support prospective speakers, the SciPy Program Committee is hosting proposal writing office hours ahead of the CFP deadline. These sessions are a chance to ask questions about the CFP, get feedback, and brainstorm ideas with members of the program and tutorial committees. First-time speakers and folks from under-represented groups are especially encouraged to attend, though all are welcome (even if you’re still deciding whether to submit!). 

Office Hours Schedule (EST):
- Tuesday, February 3, 3:00–4:00 PM
