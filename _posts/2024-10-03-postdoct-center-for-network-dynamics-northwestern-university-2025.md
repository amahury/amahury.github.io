The Center for Network Dynamics at Northwestern University is actively seeking postdoctoral researcher applicants interested in complex systems and networks. We welcome applications from individuals with expertise in various aspects of network science relevant to the modeling of biological, physical, and engineering systems, including systems with temporal, multilayer, and higher-order interactions. Specific topics of interest include AI/ML in network science, network inference, control of network systems, cascading failures, synchronization phenomena, biophysical networks, quantum networks, energy systems, coupled laser systems, metamaterial networks, and microfluidic networks. The projects are theoretical and computational but benefit from empirical data and close collaborations with experimental colleagues.

The positions are open to recent PhDs in physics, materials science, applied mathematics, computer science, engineering, and related fields. Competitive candidates will have outstanding computational, analytical, and communication skills, and demonstrated ability to conduct high-impact research. Ideal candidates will also have familiarity with one of the following areas: network science, nonlinear dynamics, statistical physics, data science, machine learning, and/or the application of interest.

Appointments are available immediately and can be renewed for up to three years. Salary is competitive and commensurate with qualifications. In exceptional cases, more experienced researchers may also be considered for research faculty positions.

The Center is located on the Evanston Campus of Northwestern University, on the north shore of Lake Michigan, within a 30-minute drive from downtown Chicago. Center members have offices in the Technological Institute and enjoy substantial interactions with network researchers from various disciplines. For more information, please explore our website: https://cnd.northwestern.edu/.

To apply, candidates should email a CV and a brief description of how their research interests relate to this position to Professor Adilson Motter at motter@northwestern.edu. Applications are reviewed on a continuous basis. Reference letters may be requested after the initial review.

Northwestern University is an Affirmative Action/Equal Opportunity Employer. Applications from women and individuals from underrepresented groups are encouraged.
