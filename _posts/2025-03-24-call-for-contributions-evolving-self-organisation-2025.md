### About
Recent dramatic advances in the problem-solving capabilities and scale of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems have enabled their successful application in challenging real-world scientific and engineering problems (Abramson et al 2024, Lam et al 2023). Yet these systems remain brittle to small disturbances and adversarial attacks (Su et al 2019, Cully 2014), lack human-level generalisation capabilities (Chollet 2019), and require alarming amounts of human, energy and financial resources (Strubel et al 2019).

Biological systems, on the other hand, seem to have largely solved many of these issues. They are capable of developing into complex organisms from a few cells and regenerating limbs through highly energy-efficient processes shaped by evolution. They do so through self-organisation: collectives of simple components interact locally with each other to give rise to macroscopic properties in the absence of centralised control (Camazine, 2001). This ability to self-organise renders organisms adaptive to their environments and robust to unexpected failures, as the redundancy built in the collective enables repurposing components, crucially, by leveraging the same self-organisation process that created the system in the first place.

Self-organisation lies at the core of many computational systems that exhibit properties such as robustness, adaptability, scalability and open-ended dynamics. Some examples are Cellular Automata (Von Neumann 1966), and their more recent counterparts such as Neural Cellular Automata (Mordvintsev et al 2020) and Lenia (Chan, 2019), reaction-diffusion systems (Turing 1992, Mordvintsev 2021), and particle systems (Reynolds 1987, Mordvintsev) . Examples from neuroevolution are indirect encodings of neural networks inspired from morphogenesis such as cellular encodings (Gruau 1992), HyperNEAT (Stanley et al 2009), Hypernetworks (Ha 2016), HyperNCA (Najarro et al 2022) and Neural Developmental Programs (Najarro et al 2023, Nisioti et al 2024), showing improved robustness and generalisation. Aside biological evolution, cultural evolution can also lead to open-ended systems, such as human culture, aspects of which have been captured by computational models of social dynamics, as with Schelling's model (Schelling, 1978), Spatial Social Dilemmas (Nowak and May, 1992) and, more recently, groups of Large Language Models (Nisioti el al, 2024).

Guiding self-organising systems through evolution is a long-standing and promising practise, yet the inherent complexity of the dynamics of these systems complicates their scaling to domains where gradient-based methods or simpler models excel (Risi 2021). If we view self-organising systems as genotype to phenotype mappings, we can leverage techniques developed in the evolutionary optimization community to understand how they alter evolutionary dynamics and guide them better.

The reverse is also possible: evolution can emerge as an inherent property of a self-organising system allowing us to study questions about the origin of life. Investigating under which conditions they appear, and the particular emergent evolutionary behaviours in these systems could afford insights applicable to existing artificial evolutionary approaches, or even directly provide an evolutionary substrate for learning tasks and achieving open-endedness. Early work in this direction (Ray 1992, Agüera y Arcas et al 2024, Fontana 1990, Adami et al 1994, Rasmussen et al 1991) has demonstrated emergent evolution in several computational substrates.

### Submission
We invite authors to submit papers through the Gecco submission system focused on the above subjects. We encourage two categories of submissions: papers of up to four pages showcasing early research ideas and papers up to 8 pages presenting more substantial contributions (such as technical contributions, benchmarks, negative results, surveys). Page count excludes references and appendices and submissions should follow the Gecco format . We encourage submissions related to evolution and self-organisation that address the following questions:
- How can we evolve artificial systems that exhibit robustness, generalisation, and adaptability?
- What properties are missing from current self-organising systems? Can we design new ones?
- How can we analyse the trainability/navigability of self-organising systems?
- How can evolutionary processes such as self-replication emerge in a self-organising system?
- Which benchmarks/environments will reveal the benefit of self-organising systems?
- Which scientific and engineering domains would benefit from the development of such systems?

The workshop is part of the GECCO conference that will take place in Málaga, Spain from July 14 to July 18. The exact day and time have not been fixed yet, but, traditionally, workshops at GECCO take place during the first two days. It will be possible to participate virtually, we will stream the talks via Zoom and accommodate online poster presentations, but encourage attendees to join us in-person for the best experience. Accepted workshop papers will be published as part of a Companion volume to the conference proceedings in the ACM Digital library.

### Important dates
- Submission deadline: April 2, 2025
- Notification: April 28, 2025
- Camera ready: May 5, 2025
- Author's mandatory registration: May 8, 2025
