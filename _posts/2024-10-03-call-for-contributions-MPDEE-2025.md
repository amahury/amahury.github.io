The Conference on Models in Population Dynamics, Ecology, and Evolution (MPDEE 2025) is organized by the Mathematical and Theoretical Biology Group (MTB) at the Basque Center for Applied Mathematics (BCAM) in Bilbao, Basque Country, Spain. The event will take place at the Basque Center for Applied Mathematics in Bilbao, Spain, from 5-9 of May, 2025.

The meeting will consider applications of mathematical modelling to explore processes and mechanisms in various biological systems ranging from a cell to the human society. A special focus will be on the interplay between ecology and evolution across time and space, in particular under the effect of climate change. MPDEEâ€™25 is also expected to explore similarities between modelling techniques traditionally applied in ecology and evolution and those used in other life sciences with the purpose to enhance interdisciplinary approaches and to stimulate further advances in population dynamics, ecology and evolution. The meeting will be an open forum for interaction between theoreticians and empirical biologists with the main goal of enhancing communication between the two groups to better link theories with empirical realities.
