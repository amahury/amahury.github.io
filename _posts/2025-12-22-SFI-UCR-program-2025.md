### Program Overview
The SFI Undergraduate Complexity Research (UCR) program is a 10-week residential experience in complexity science research. Each student develops a project in collaboration with their mentor(s); projects are selected and refined through discussions early in the program, based on ideas from students and SFI researchers. Students learn how to combine theory, methods, and data from the physical, natural, and social sciences to ask big questions about real-world complex systems using the rigorous methods employed at SFI. Through a series of seminars and workshops, students enhance their skills as researchers and prepare for the next steps in their academic and professional journeys. 

### Dates & Times
May 31 – August 8, 2026

The UCR program is a full-time (work-day) commitment. All participants are expected to attend the entire 10-week program in person.

### Stipend & Support
Students receive a stipend of $7,000 over the course of the program. All UCRs are provided with housing and meals at no cost to them, as well as travel support to/from Santa Fe, New Mexico.

Program Support   The Santa Fe Institute UCR program is supported by the National Science Foundation BIO REU (Award No. 2349052) and SFI’s generous donors — Darla Moore Foundation, McKinnon Family Foundation, Bengier Foundation, and Eugene & Jean Stark.

### Goals
- Explore new ideas through an independent transdisciplinary research project, guided by an SFI mentor
- Develop a deeper understanding of complex systems research through discussions and seminars
- Become a part of the SFI research network and connect with new colleagues and collaborators
- Build technical and professional skills such as effective science communication, robust research methods, and outcome-driven collaboration
- Learn about and explore the diverse future career opportunities of those studying complexity science
- Join a small, collegial, and enthusiastic UCR community who help each other succeed – even after the end of summer

### Audience
Undergraduate students from all backgrounds in the physical, natural, and social sciences and mathematics are invited to participate. Strong quantitative skills and/or experience with a programming language are favorably considered. Please refer to the “Applying” tab for details regarding eligibility.

The UCR team is committed to offering programs in which all participants feel valued and supported in their learning journey. We believe that open discourse and the respectful sharing of broad perspectives is essential to meaningful scientific progress, and we welcome you to join us.
