There is also potential for collaboration with other relevant units such as the Network Science Institute.

The ideal candidate will conduct original research at the intersection of network science, communication, and media, and/or will advance computational communication research using network analysis approaches. In this position, the successful candidate will develop and teach core undergraduate and graduate courses in our communication studies degree programs. We encourage applicants whose research includes but is not limited to any of the following topics:

The College is seeking to give excellent candidates across all demographics of society the opportunity, resources, and support to establish innovative and impactful research careers. This includes candidates at the earliest stages of their careers as well as those who are more established. For selected candidates, there may be an option of a 1- to 2-year CAMD funded, mentored post-doc Fellow position, to allow candidates to ramp up their research programs before starting on the tenure track.
