We have an opening for a postdoctoral position, and would like to kindly ask that you share this opportunity with grad students who may be interested in working with me on topics related to interdependence and cooperation. I will also be reviewing graduate student applications this cycle, and would be grateful if you shared this information with undergraduate students with an interest in emotions, interdependence, and cooperation. Thank you for your time.

### About the position
The SPECIEs (Social Psychology of Evolutionary Cooperation, Interdependence, and Emotions) Lab in the psychology department at the University of Arizona is hiring a Research Scientist (i.e., postdoctoral scholar). This is a 3 year position at $65k/year (yearly contracts with renewal). The postdoc will be involved in the analysis of existing field data on cooperation and well-being among the Mayangna of Nicaragua, help in the design and development of new projects (e.g., experiments, large-scale cross-cultural surveys, ecological momentary assessment), and conduct fieldwork in the Bosawas biosphere reserve of Northern Nicaragua during two field visits, each lasting 1-3 months. Therefore, the candidate must be fluent in Spanish, and willing to conduct fieldwork in a remote area (i.e., no basic services like water, sewage, electricity, etc.). The researcher will also collaborate on ongoing projects, gain mentorship, and professional development. The ideal candidate has strong skills in statistics (e.g., SEM, multi-level models, longitudinal data, social networks), data visualization, and is knowledgeable in the science of cooperation/prosocial behavior, the evolutionary human sciences, and/or affective science.
