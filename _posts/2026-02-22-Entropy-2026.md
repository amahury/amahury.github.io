### About the Event
Entropy is one of science's most frequently used terms, owing to its foundational relevance in two major disciplines: physics and information theory. Originally rooted in thermodynamics, the concept of entropy has, since Shannon’s pioneering work, become central to the understanding of information processing and communication.

This conference is organised by MDPI's open-access journal Entropy (ISSN 1099-4300; IF: 2.0) and presents a unique opportunity to unite researchers from both fields, fostering collaboration and cross-disciplinary innovation.

We particularly welcome interdisciplinary contributions from both theoretical and applied perspectives. Submissions may also address conceptual and methodological advances, as well as innovative applications of entropy and information theory across a broad range of domains.

### Registration
The conference will be held fully in person; it is not possible to participate online. The registration fee includes attendance at all conference sessions, morning/afternoon coffee breaks, lunches, a conference bag, and a program book. Participation in the conference is considered final only once the registration fees have been paid. The number of participants is limited: once the number of paid registrations reaches the maximum number of participants, unpaid registrations will be canceled.

Please note that abstract submission and conference registration are two separate processes. During registration, please provide us with the same email address you used to submit your abstract(s). Otherwise, leave us a comment in the registration form, providing the email address used during the submission process. In addition, please use your institutional email address for both processes.

In order to finalize the scientific program in due time, at least one registration by any of the authors, denoted as the Covering Author, is required to cover the presentation and publication of any accepted abstract. The Covering Author registration deadline is 31 March 2026. Your abstract will be withdrawn if your registration is not complete by this date.

Participants of the event will be able to download an electronic Certificate of Attendance by accessing their dashboards on Sciforum.net once the event is concluded. The certificates will be found under the "My Certificates" category

### Submission 
Entropy 2026 will accept abstracts only. The accepted abstracts will be available online on Sciforum.net during and after the conference.

The conference will be held fully in person; it is not possible to participate online. Please note that abstract submission and conference registration are two separate processes. Please use your institutional email address for both processes.

To present your research at the event
- Create an account on Sciforum if you do not have one, then click on ‘New Submission’ in the upper-right corner of the window; or, click on ‘Submit Abstract’ at the top of this webpage.
- Choose a session that is best suited for your research.
- Submit an abstract in English—the word limits are a minimum of 200 words and a maximum of 300 words.
- The deadline to submit your abstract is 1 March 2026.
- Upon submission, you can select if you wish to be considered for oral or poster presentation (or both). Following assessment by the Chairs and Scientific Committee, you will be notified by 30 March 2026 whether your contribution has been accepted for oral or poster presentation.
- Please note that, in order to finalize the scientific program in due time, at least one registration by any of the authors, denoted as Covering Author, is required to cover the presentation and publication of any accepted abstract. The Covering Author registration deadline is 31 March 2026. Your abstract will be withdrawn if your registration is not complete by this date.
- All abstracts accepted for presentation will be collected in a book of abstracts, which will be displayed on the website during the conference.

Authors are encouraged to prepare their presentations using PowerPoint or similar software. Please note that all presentations must be delivered in English. A link for slide upload will be provided prior to the conference.

Each presenter will be provided with a vertical poster board. The poster size is 90 cm x 140 cm. Please print your poster prior to the conference. A plan of the poster session will be circulated later on.
