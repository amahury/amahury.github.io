description: Are you a scholar of the social sciences looking to include computational approaches in your research? Consider SFI’s Graduate Workshop in Computational Social Science — a two-week, in-residence program where participants explore tools from complex systems and computation, advance their own research, and collaborate on a hackathon-style challenge.

### Program Overview
The Graduate Workshop brings together a group of advanced Ph.D. students and a small faculty for an intensive two-week study of computational social science modeling and complexity. Participants will learn how to apply tools and approaches from complex systems and computation to questions in the social sciences, while advancing their independent research and working collaboratively with fellow participants. The Graduate Workshop convenes in-person and consists of seminars, independent research, formal and informal discussions, and a hackathon-style challenge.

### Dates & Times
May 24 - June 5, 2026

The Graduate Workshop is a full-time (all-day) commitment. All participants are expected to attend the entire program in person and be in-residence full time.

### Registration Fee
Registration fee: $2,800. The registration fee for the program covers course-associated costs, materials, and accommodations plus lunch each weekday. Students are responsible for the cost of travel and all other meals during the program.

Participants generally secure funding to attend from multiple sources, including their home institution and third-party funding sources. There is a limited amount of scholarship support available. Once accepted, participants may apply for a partial registration fee waiver from SFI based on need. Every applicant for financial assistance will need to demonstrate that they made substantial efforts to obtain funding elsewhere.

### Goals
- Collaborate on an intensive, hackathon-style problem as a member of a team composed of fellow program participants.
- Advance independent Ph.D. research with guidance from program faculty and insight from peers.
- Connect with social scientists interested in computation and complexity and identify future collaborators and colleagues.
- Explore a breadth of current topics in computational social science and complexity research.

### Audience
The Graduate Workshop is aimed at Ph.D. students who ideally have completed a minimum of two years of Ph.D. study (or equivalent research experience) and are actively pursuing thesis research in computational social science. Participation in the workshop is limited to 10 students. Early career researchers including postdocs and new faculty will be considered. 

Applicants from any country are welcome. Accepted applicants who are not US citizens or permanent residents will receive assistance with visa sponsorship as appropriate to their individual circumstances.

The Graduate Workshop team is committed to offering programs in which all participants feel valued and supported in their learning journey. We believe that open discourse and the respectful sharing of broad perspectives is essential to meaningful scientific progress, and we welcome you to join us.

### Eligibility
This program is designed for Ph.D. students who have completed a minimum of two years of Ph.D. study (or equivalent research experience) and are actively pursuing thesis research in computational social science. Early career researchers including postdocs and new faculty will also be considered.

### Application Requirements
While the application period is open, access the application system through the "Apply now!" button at the top right of your screen.

Applicants should submit:
- Biographical information (filled out directly in the application portal).
- An outline of a current or proposed research project in complex and/or computational social sciences (maximum one page).
- Current academic CV or résumé, including a list of publications, if any.
- One academic letter of recommendation.
- Contact information for two additional academic references.

### Application Process & Timeline
Applications must be completed and submitted through the application portal by the posted deadline. Late or incomplete applications are not reviewed.

Complete applications submitted by the deadline will be evaluated by the Graduate Workshop review committee. All applicants — including those not selected as finalists — will receive an email update on their status in March. The Graduate Workshop maintains a waiting list. Some years, the program has been able to offer spots to those on the waiting list.

Because a missing recommendation letter can hold up an otherwise strong application, you should contact your recommender as soon as you begin your application. Materials submitted after the deadline cannot be added and will not be considered.

All inquiries about the application should be directed to education@santafe.edu
