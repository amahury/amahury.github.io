### About the offer
The Visual Intelligence Laboratory ('Baek Lab') in collaboration with the Connected Data Hub (‘Gates Lab’) at the University of Virginia School of Data Science is seeking a motivated and self-driven postdoctoral researcher for pioneering research at the convergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and materials science. The ideal candidate should possess expertise in scientific machine learning (SciML)—topics including, but not limited to:
- Physics-informed neural networks (PINN) & neural operators
- Physics-aware convolutional neural networks (PARC)
- Meta-learning/transfer learning, small data learning
- Active learning, Bayesian deep learning, uncertainty quantification
- Graph neural networks

This position involves active participation in a well-funded research program sponsored by federal agencies such as the U.S. Department of Defense and the National Science Foundation (NSF). The focus of the research is on developing innovative physics-informed deep learning algorithms on graphs to model, characterize, predict, and design the thermal and physical behaviors of diverse material systems. Responsibilities also include the development of software codes, dissemination of research through publications, and mentoring PhD students. The labs’ extensive collaborative networks, both nationally and internationally, span various disciplines, offering diverse applications across physics, mechanical engineering, materials sciences, network science, and more. This multidisciplinary and highly collaborative environment provides an exceptional opportunity for candidates to thrive and become sought-after experts in SciML, with numerous opportunities in academic, government, and industry positions.

The position is offered for one year, continuation is contingent upon funding and satisfactory performance.

The selected applicant will be required to complete a background check prior to their first day of employment per University policy.

### Minimum Qualifications
- Effective written and verbal communication skills.
- PhD degree in computer science, data science, or related fields, to be completed by the start date of the appointment.
- Strong software development/engineering skills.
- Mathematical proficiency, with a focus on subjects including linear algebra, vector calculus, optimization, and statistics/probability.
