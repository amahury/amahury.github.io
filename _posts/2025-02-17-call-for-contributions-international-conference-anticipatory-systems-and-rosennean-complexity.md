Inaugurated by Dr. Robert Rosen, Anticipatory Systems Theory deals with how systems with the ability to anticipate model and act on future states. This conference aims to address anticipation in its many forms, including its philosophical, biological, cognitive, and technological dimensions. This year (2025) will also mark the 40th anniversary of the original publication of Rosen’s “Anticipatory Systems: Philosophical, Mathematical, and Methodological Foundations”, an occasion that we shall celebrate in our conference. 

In this first edition, attendance will be free of charge. 

### Relevant Topics

We welcome contributions in, but not limited to, the following areas:
- Philosophy of Science: Exploring the epistemological and metaphysical underpinnings of anticipatory systems, as well as their current and future role in scientific explanation.
- Cognitive Science: Investigating the role of anticipation in contemporary, non-mechanistic cognitive science.
- Theoretical Biology: Understanding life through the lenses of relational biology and Rosen’s anticipatory systems.
- Foundational Mathematics of Relational Biology: Advancing formal frameworks for understanding organisms.
- Complex Systems: Examining the role of anticipation in dynamic, nonlinear systems, as well as in emergent behaviour.
- Medicine: Applying anticipation to predictive diagnostics, personalized treatment, and healthcare systems.
- Artificial Intelligence: Studying anticipatory artificial intelligent systems, as well as their ethical and practical implications.
- Climate Crisis: Leveraging anticipatory systems theory as strategy to address challenges related to climate change, including mitigation, adaptation, and sustainability.

### Presentation Modalities
Participants may choose from the following presentation formats:
- Oral Presentations: 25-minute talks followed by a 5-minute Q&A session, designed for sharing significant findings or conceptual advancements.
- Panel Discussions: Collaborative sessions featuring 3-5 panelists addressing a specific topic related to anticipation, with a moderator facilitating audience interaction.
- Workshops: Interactive, hands-on sessions aimed at exploring specific tools, methods, or approaches to anticipation in depth.

### Important Dates
- Abstract Submission Deadline: February 28, 2025
- Notification of Acceptance: March 10, 2025.

### Venue & Accomodation
This conference will be an in-person event to be celebrated in the Central Campus of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, in Mexico City (Mexico). Nearby hotels and other accommodation recomendations will be sent to all accepted authors.
