### About 
The Doctoral Research Fellow will contribute to ongoing research on Novel Methods for Enabling Novelty and Creativity in AI Systems. This may include working with Neural Cellular Automata, Abstraction and Reasoning, Bio-Inspired and Neuro-Inspired AI, Artificial Evolutionary and Developmental Systems, Alignment, Social Learning and Cultural Evolution, and other Artificial Life techniques. 

The doctoral position is part of the research initiative “The Digital Society” at ØUC.

### Project description
Human creativity faces unprecedented challenges but also opportunities due to generative AI, understood here as machine systems that can produce novel and creative results. Several important questions are raised: to what extent are generative AI systems genuinely creative? How do they differ from human and biological creativity? To what extent can AI systems abstract and reason? How can we enable AI to become more open-ended and therefore able to generate novel and creative outcomes that go beyond what they observed as part of their training data? Furthermore, how can creative AI systems produce novel outcomes that are aligned with our ethical and societal standards?

This PhD project will focus on basic research and will explore if and how systems can autonomously set and pursue novel goals, adapt to new challenges, and continue learning over time, while remaining aligned to ethical and societal values. Weight will be placed into developing non-obtrusive ways to interface with the human creative process with a focus on real-time interactions. 

This PhD position, hosted and financed by the Østfold University College, will be part of the MishMash centre. MishMash is one of the 6 national AI centres and will conduct research at the intersection of AI and creativity. The PhD student is therefore expected to actively participate in the relevant activities of the MishMash centre.
