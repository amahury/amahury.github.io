### About
NetBioMed is a satellite that was conceived in 2020 by combining the strengths of two previous highly successful satellites, NetMed and NetSciReg, which ran at NetSci from 2013 to 2019. NetBioMed is dedicated to the integrated fields of Network Science, Biology, and Medicine, and has been well-attended by a wide audience of scientists at NetSci every year since 2020.

Network science has been widely used to study biomedical systems from genetic interactions to comorbidity trajectories, as well as the structure of the brain and many other examples. Constructing and analyzing those networks has been facilitated by the availability of large health data and Machine Learning (ML) techniques uncovering relationships within those datasets. At the same time, this abundance of data allows for personalized biomedical studies using Digital Twins (DT), in-silico models of the human body. That is, the Big Data era brought to biomedical sciences the possibility of multiscale data integration based on complex networks frameworks. However, the extent to which they are capable of explaining and generating mechanistic hypotheses requires transdisciplinary collaborations. Therefore, in 2025, NetBioMed will bring together researchers working with Machine Learning, Digital Twins and Complex Systems in order to incentivize transdisciplinary collaborations leveraging the potentials of network science tools in the future of biology and medicine.

This satellite aims to bring together network scientists whose research focuses on biomedical applications and biomedical scientists who are interested in learning about how network approaches can be used to study biological or disease systems. Based on NetBioMedâ€™s reception and an enthusiastic audience over the past five years, we anticipate that there will be a high level of interest in biomedical networks at NetSci, justifying this satellite symposium.
