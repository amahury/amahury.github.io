description: A recent study published in Nature shows that the two most accepted theories to explain consciousness turn out to be insufficient, leaving room for a potential general theory of consciousness. Among all the possible models of consciousness, today I will talk about quantum consciousness, a narrative that has received multiple criticisms and much skepticism, but has recently begun to be experimentally supported.

### Introduction
Since ancient times, [consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness)—our subjective sense of being and experiencing—has captivated philosophers and scientists alike. The quest to unravel the relationship between brain activity and subjective experiences such as [qualia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia) has fostered numerous theories. As described by [Robert Lawrence Kuhn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Lawrence_Kuhn) in his recent [ _consciousness taxonomy_](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079610723001128?via%3Dihub), these explanations range across diverse spectrums from strictly [physicalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicalism) interpretations—like neurobiological, computational, and representational frameworks—to more esoteric and non-physical approaches, including [dualisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dualism) and [idealisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealism). Notably, theories like [Integrated Information Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_information_theory) (IIT) and [Global Neuronal Workspace Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_workspace_theory) (GNWT) have achieved prominence, proposing radically distinct neural substrates for consciousness: IIT situates it within the [posterior cortical regions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_cortex), emphasizing intrinsic connectivity, whereas GNWT locates it in the [frontal cortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontal_lobe), highlighting information broadcasting across networks.

A significant recent endeavor—detailed in the paper “[Adversarial testing of global neuronal workspace and integrated information theories of consciousness](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08888-1)”—attempted to resolve these competing theories empirically. This rigorous study directly juxtaposed IIT and GNWT through sophisticated neuroimaging experiments involving functional magnetic resonance imaging ([fMRI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging)) and electroencephalography ([EEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography)), yet the results significantly challenged both theories. Neither IIT nor GNWT entirely withstood empirical scrutiny, with key predictions failing, thus underscoring our ongoing lack of a general theory of consciousness.

However, both IIT and GNWT are just the tip of the iceberg, where a plethora of [models of consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Models_of_consciousness) await testing. Given these inconclusive findings, perhaps it is timely to explore theories once considered fringe or unconventional. Among such ideas, we find the concept of [quantum consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mind), which posits a quantum basis underlying conscious experience. Initially met with skepticism, quantum consciousness has begun attracting scientific interest as researchers explore its empirical validity, suggesting it may soon move from speculative margins into mainstream discourse.

### The Penrose–Lucas Argument
To fully appreciate quantum consciousness, we must first understand the [Penrose–Lucas argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose%E2%80%93Lucas_argument), deeply rooted in [Gödel’s incompleteness theorems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems). These theorems assert that any sufficiently robust [formal system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_system)—essentially a finite set of axioms and rules from which theorems are derived—cannot simultaneously be both complete and consistent. A consistent system (like conventional arithmetic) contains no contradictions but consequently remains incomplete, leaving certain truths unprovable within its boundaries. This foundational concept profoundly implies limits to algorithmic reasoning, as rigorously explored in [modern computational theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_computation).

This raises an intriguing question: if all formal or algorithmic systems are constrained by Gödel’s incompleteness, could non-algorithmic processes exist outside such constraints? Here, [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics) introduces an intriguing possibility. [Quantum superposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition)—the coexistence of multiple potential states within quantum systems—presents a candidate for a fundamentally non-algorithmic process. Crucially, [quantum measurement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_problem), causing a [collapse of the wavefunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function_collapse) from superposed states into a single observable state, is inherently unpredictable and non-deterministic. This collapse could thus evade the limitations posed by Gödel's theorems.

British philosopher [John Lucas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lucas_(philosopher)) first formulated the idea that human reasoning might transcend formal systems limited by incompleteness. Physicist and Nobel Laureate [Sir Roger Penrose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Penrose) later popularized this argument, suggesting in his seminal book “[The Emperor's New Mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emperor%27s_New_Mind)” that consciousness might fundamentally depend on such quantum-mechanical collapses. Penrose proposed that human cognitive processes exhibit capabilities beyond purely algorithmic computation, thereby possibly indicating a quantum basis for consciousness. Despite Penrose’s eminence in physics, initial responses to this provocative suggestion were overwhelmingly skeptical, primarily due to its speculative nature and lack of experimental verification.

### Orch OR: A Biological Basis for Quantum Consciousness
The quantum consciousness hypothesis found renewed vigor through collaboration between Penrose and anesthesiologist [Stuart Hameroff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Hameroff), leading to the formulation of the [Orchestrated Objective Reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestrated_objective_reduction) (Orch OR) theory. Hameroff, intrigued by the enigmatic anesthetic properties of chemically inert noble gases such as xenon, argon, and krypton, proposed that their anesthetic effects stemmed from interactions within neuronal [microtubules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtubule)—protein filaments crucial for cellular structure and intracellular transport. 

Hameroff hypothesized that anesthetics disrupt microtubule vibrations by binding within [tubulin proteins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubulin), consequently modifying their quantum state dynamics and resulting in unconsciousness. Microtubules thus became central to the Orch OR model, with Hameroff suggesting they could host quantum computations within neurons, explaining why all our multiple attempts of building [artificial general intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence) have failed. According to this view, orchestrated collapses of quantum states within microtubules generate the subjective experiences constituting consciousness, where every instant of quantum collapse conforms to our subjective experience. 

Subsequent research highlighted microtubules' unique quantum potential, particularly demonstrated by collective phenomena like [ultraviolet superradiance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superradiance) from tryptophan networks within tubulin proteins. Experimental validation provided initial support for Orch OR by demonstrating how cooperative quantum effects could persist in biologically realistic, ambient-temperature environments, bolstering claims that quantum dynamics might genuinely influence neural processes underlying consciousness.

### Feasibility and Experimental Progress
Despite its innovative approach, quantum consciousness remains heavily debated, primarily due to three prominent criticisms. First, [quantum computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing) remains algorithmic by nature, challenging the premise that quantum mechanics inherently transcends Gödelian constraints. Second, introducing random quantum collapses does not intuitively resolve how consciousness could exceed algorithmic limitations—it merely replaces determinism with stochasticity. Lastly, [quantum coherence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_decoherence)—key to achieving consciousness according to Orch OR—typically requires pristine environments rarely found in biological contexts; neurons operate in warm, noisy conditions, seemingly incompatible with delicate quantum effects, such that the more particles involved in a quantum state the more easily the state gets destroyed.

Nevertheless, skepticism has recently softened as researchers begin experimental testing. [Christof Koch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christof_Koch), previously critical of quantum models, has notably advocated for a robust [research program](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/26/6/460) exploring quantum biology experiments that might validate or falsify Orch OR claims. Koch’s proposal outlines experimental tests specifically designed to detect quantum phenomena within biological tissues. Moreover, [recent breakthroughs](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcb.3c07936) like observed ultraviolet superradiance from biological tryptophan mega-networks empirically demonstrate quantum coherence in biologically relevant conditions, representing compelling evidence supporting Orch OR theory.

These studies represent a crucial shift from skepticism towards empirical inquiry, marking quantum consciousness as a scientifically testable hypothesis rather than purely philosophical speculation.

### Conclusion
Quantum consciousness, while still controversial, is gaining empirical traction. Yet, definitive proof remains elusive, demanding further rigorous experimentation. Quantum approaches compel us toward a profound paradigm shift, suggesting that consciousness might emerge from scale-invariant biological processes, extending from macroscopic neuronal networks down to quantum dynamics within microtubules. Indeed, embracing quantum consciousness requires a willingness to explore deeper, potentially faster classical and quantum phenomena, acknowledging significant knowledge gaps regarding how such effects might robustly manifest in living organisms. If consciousness is dependent on microtubules, that would explain why we observe degrees of consciousness in other life forms, from animals to plants. 

Ultimately, integrating quantum mechanics into consciousness research presents both a challenge and an extraordinary opportunity. As experimentation progresses, we may uncover profound insights, redefining our understanding of consciousness and opening new scientific horizons previously considered beyond reach. Personally, I have been triggered by quantum consciousness as an alternative to the big theories of consciousness. However, if consciousness is quantum, and even became before life—as [recently argued](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XA9Q5p9ODac) by Hameroff, what does that mean physically? What is the physicalist/holistic interpretation of that? If consciousness is fundamental, then what is next?
