The way we use, interact, and interface with technology is always changing. With the advent of accessible and easy-to-use AI tools, we are seeing these changes develop at an unprecedented rate. What new and unexplored interfaces might we experience next?

In this week-long workshop, you will collaborate with leading researchers, early career researchers, technologists, and innovators from across disciplines to discuss the intersection of artificial intelligence, ethics, embodied cognition, and advanced interface design. There will be inspiring panels from leading experts, a multi-day hackathon, and deep-dive discussions on ideas encountered throughout the week.

There will be opportunities for continued support for ideas developed during the workshop. This includes avenues to publish in the IMI journal, mentoring, fostering research collaborations, and to develop technology that prioritize accessibility, real-world impact, and user-centric design.

### Agenda
#### March 3rd: Poster Session, Reception, Keynote Speakers & Discussions
Early career researchers are invited to bring posters to discuss their latest results, ideas, and projects. Inspiring talks from keynote speakers and a discussion will follow. This session will also feature a catered reception.

This session will start with an inspiring panel discussion by leading experts in human-machine interfaces.

Then, participants will explain their proposed hackathon topics, ask questions, and seek clarification. Groups of participants will work together to brainstorm, design, and develop new solutions.

Two weeks before the workshop, participants will be asked to propose hackathon topics and assemble into groups.

#### March 5th: Augmentation Hackathon (Part 2)
