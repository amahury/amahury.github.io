description: A Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics (Kyoto University) workshop on Quantum Thermodynamics and Stochastic Thermodynamics will take place Dec 8–12. The talk submission deadline is 21 Sept. With an excellent lineup of invited and long-talk speakers, it’s well worth joining for anyone interested in these fields and Resource Theory!

### Schedule and Venue
December 8-12, 2025 

Panasonic Auditorium, Yukawa Hall, YITP, Kyoto University, Japan

### Scope
Recent advances in physics have increasingly highlighted the need to understand energy conversion at microscopic scales—a regime where quantum phenomena and statistical fluctuations coexist. On one hand, quantum thermodynamics seeks to extend concepts in thermodynamics into the quantum realm, grappling with effects such as coherence, entanglement, and quantum fluctuations. On the other hand, stochastic thermodynamics provides a framework to analyze energy processes in systems where random thermal fluctuations dominate, especially in small-scale or nonequilibrium settings. With the integration of these two approaches, quantum stochastic thermodynamics is rapidly emerging. 

At the heart of this emerging intersection lies a fundamental question: How do quantum effects modify the limits of thermodynamic or informational devices? To answer this question, a wealth of insights—including resource theory, non-Markovianity, and optimal transport theory—is currently flowing into quantum stochastic thermodynamics. 

This conference aims to bring together leading experts in quantum stochastic thermodynamics and foster interactions that will accelerate progress in this new frontier. The conference will be held in person to enhance active interactions. We look forward to seeing you in Kyoto in December 2025.
