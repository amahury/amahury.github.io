### About The Event
Temporal networks model systems where entities and interactions evolve over time. Unlike static networks, they capture how changing structures influence key processes by incorporating the timing, order, and duration of connections—crucial in applications ranging from mobility routing to disease spreading. Growing data availability and computational advances have accelerated interest in temporal networks, yet many challenges remain.

At TENET (TEmporal NETworks), we invite contributions that advance temporal network theory, methods, and applications. The satellite brings together researchers from diverse fields to explore how networks change, adapt, and respond to internal and external forces.

### Important Dates
- Submission deadline: 20th Febuary 2026
- Notification: 9th March 2026
- Pitch talk deadline: 4th May 2026
- Event: 1st June 2026

### Topics
We welcome contributions on Temporal Networks (also referred to as Dynamic Graphs, Stream Graphs, Time-Varying Networks, Evolving Networks, or Link Streams) applied to any real-world contexts in conjunction with various fields, such as:
- Network Measures And Metrics
- Graph machine learning
- Modeling fairness and ethics
- Link prediction
- Software for temporal graph analysis
- Dynamic community detection
- Event detection
- Signed Networks
- Higher-order interactional data
- Network Data Collection

### Submissions
For contributed talks, submissions will undergo single-blind peer review with a minimum of two reviewers per paper. Submissions should be at most two pages long in PDF format (including references and only one figure) and should include title, author(s), and affiliation(s). Submissions that do not conform to these requirements will not be reviewed.

The pitch talks session offers a dynamic, fast-paced format where researchers have two minutes to present their work and research identity. This format welcomes both established researchers and newcomers to share their work at any stage – from published results to emerging ideas. Submissions for pitch talks are handled through a simple online form asking for a title and a very short abstract (online form) and are reviewed by the satellite organizers. Each accepted pitch talk will also be assigned a poster during the satellite poster session. Authors whose works are not selected for contributed talks can be invited to participate in the pitch talks (with poster) session.

For questions related to the submission or participation, please contact the organisers at gald@itu.dk.
