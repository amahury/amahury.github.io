description: The aim of LANET is to provide with a forum to join all scientists who are somehow related to the research on Network Science in Latin America. The rapid growth of the field of Network Science in the last two decades has manifested in the form of schools, workshops and conferences in Latin America. However, the creation of LANET as a stable and periodic forum devoted to Network Science will further spur the formation of research groups interested in the field and help to establish it as a discipline across Latin American Universities and Research Institutions.

### General Information
The aim of the LANET is to provide the scientific community working in Network Sciences of Latin America a forum to meet, foster collaborations, disseminate results, and promote the cross-fertilization of ideas from different areas.

This meeting is also structured to encourage active participation from young scientists, offering oral presentations, posters, and a school on the fundamentals of network theory and applications on the 28th of July.

The first edition was organized by the Benemérita Universidad Autónoma de Puebla (Puebla, México), the second edition by the Universidad de los Andes (Cartagena de Indias, Colombia), and the third edition was co-organized by the Universidad del Pacífico and Universidad Andina del Cusco (Cusco, Perú).

We have taken the advantage of joining together the best scientists working on Network Science and organized a one-day School on Fundamentals and Applications of Network Science. The school will be held at the Conference location on the 28th of July. More about the registration and school content will be released soon. The school will be taught in Spanish.

### Contributions & Registration
Call for contributions (posters and talks) is open! CONTRIBUTIONS IN ENGLISH (PREFERRED), SPANISH OR PORTUGUESE CAN BE SUBMITTED USING THE FOLLOWING Google form UNTIL THE 18TH OF APRIL (ACCEPTANCE NOTIFICATION BEFORE 2ND OF MAY). 

REGISTRATION FEE COVERS COFFEE BREAKS, LUNCHES, EXCURSION TRIP, AND CONFERENCE MATERIALS. The CONFERENCE DINNER (WHICH INCLUDES A URUGUAYAN GRILL/BARBEQUE), is paid separately.

NATIONAL PARTICIPANTS: depósito en cuenta bancaria de FUNDACIBA en dólares (CC BROU 001562480-00002). Depósito de 150 dólares (antes del 1ero de julio) si desea participar de la cena.

### Venue & Accommodation
The conference will be held at the Centro Universitario Regional del Este (CURE, www.cure.edu.uy) of the Universidad de la República (UdelaR), Uruguay. The CURE is located at Tacuarembó street, 20100 Punta del Este, Departamento de Maldonado (between Bulevar Artigas and Avenue Aparicio Saravia).

The inter-city bus service in Uruguay is of good quality. Two bus companies, named COT and COPSA, operate between Montevideo and Punta del Este, both having bus shuttles going from Montevideo's main bus terminal (Tres Cruces) and from the airport. These buses depart from Terminal Tres Cruces at Montevideo, having a stop at the Carrasco Airport to pick up arriving passengers. Both companies have commercial offices at Tres Cruces Terminal, but only COT has a commercial office at the Carrasco Airport. The distance from Montevideo to Punta del Este is approximately 140km, which takes the bus about 2 hours from Montevideo.

Airport Bus Stop: The Bus Stop is located on the far right of the Airport Exit. Do mind that buses with destinations other than Punta del Este also call at the Airport Stop, therefore, please make sure to check that the sign stating the destination at the upper front of the bus you are going to board reads: ''Punta del Este''. You can buy the ticket on the bus after boarding, or in case of choosing COT, at the counter on their commercial office near the Airport bus stop. It is convenient to buy the ticket before boarding the bus in order to secure a seat.
