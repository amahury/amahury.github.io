The Next Era of Network Science: Nonlinear Dynamics, Multiscale Interactions and Beyond is a high-impact scientific event that brings together leading researchers to explore the future of complex networks. Covering topics such as multilayer structures, synchronization, nonlinear dynamics, and signal analysis, the program spans applications in biology, neuroscience, epidemics, mobility, and social systems. Designed to benefit both early-stage graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, the event begins with accessible introductory sessions and progresses into specialized discussions on hot topics in the field. Participants will gain exposure to cutting-edge research, engage with top scientists, and build valuable academic connections. The program also includes collaborative activities, such as hands-on projects in areas like neuroscience, social networks, spreading dynamics, sports and synchronization, to foster informal exchange and future collaboration. This is a unique opportunity to deepen your understanding of network science and become part of a vibrant, interdisciplinary community. We warmly invite students and researchers to attend and contribute to this exciting scientific gathering.

This event will precede the Workshop on Foundations and Applications of Spreading Phenomena on Complex Networks.

Deadline: December 2, 2025
