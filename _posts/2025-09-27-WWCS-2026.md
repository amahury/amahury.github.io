### About
The Winter Workshop on Complex Systems is a one-week event where young researchers worldwide come together to work on interdisciplinary projects in the field of complex systems.

The primary focus of the workshop is for participants to engage into novel research projects.

The workshop already has a long history — you can learn more about its journey in the About section — and 2026 will mark its 11th edition. The upcoming event will be held in Santuari de Lluc (Mallorca, Spain) from the 25th to the 30th of January 2026. Previously, it has been hosted in Lombardy, La Vall d’en Bas, Amsterdam, Besançon, Charmey, Zakopane, Utrecht, Petnica, Madrid, and Brussels.

### Application 
- Start of applications: August 25th
- Deadline for applications: October 6th
- Notification of acceptance: November 6th

Application is open now! To proceed with the workshop application we ask to interested individuals to submit a CV, a cover letter, and complete the application form. Bear in mind the following dates:

We aim to create an inclusive, diverse, sociable, and motivated group of young researchers. Excellent applicants with no previous experiences with complexity research will also be considered. In the last years 20-30% of applicants were invited to attend the Winter Workshop.

### Registration
The workshop registration fee is 400EUR and it includes:
- Accommodation from Sunday to Friday (5 nights).
- Breakfast, lunch, and dinners at the accommodation.
- Coffee breaks.
- Social activities.
- Bus from Palma to the accommodation.

The workshop will exclusively be an onsite event.

### Accommodation
We will provide you double rooms at Santuari de Lluc in the mountains of Tramuntana, in Mallorca. More information available in the Venue section.

### Grants
We want to make sure that everyone who is interested in the winter school has a fair chance to attend. To support participants who may not have sufficient funding, we offer a limited number of grants. If you would like to be considered, please indicate this in the application form and include a short motivation letter. This helps us make sure the grants are distributed fairly. If you have any questions about the application process, feel free to contact us by email.

## Travel grant
We hope to enable all students independent of financial means to attend the winter school. Therefore, we have reserved a limited budget for travel grants. If you are applying for a travel grant, you may upload a separate motivation letter and a list of the needded funds in the application (a different document that the cover letter for the application). With the acceptance letter, we will notify you with how much money we can support you. In case the required budget exceeds the available funds, we might not be able to cover all your needed costs.

## Other grants
In addition to travel support, there will also be grants from partner institutions that may cover registration fees or even travel costs. We are still finalizing the details, but we will share updated information before the acceptance notifications on November 6th. If you are interested in being considered for these opportunities, please indicate this clearly in your application form.

## Sicómoro grant
Fundación Sicómoro offers 3 scholarships for Spanish-speaking applicants to the workshop. To be elegible to this scholarship, you must follow these steps:

1. ⁠Pre-register for the WWCS2026: Fill out the general application form.
2. ⁠Indicate interest in the scholarship: While completing the application form, explicitly mention that you are applying for one of the three Fundación Sicómoro scholarships.
3. ⁠Submit a motivation letter: Attach a motivation letter in Spanish addressed to Fundación Sicómoro, explaining why you want to participate and why you should be awarded the scholarship. This letter of motivation should be a different letter to the cover letter for the workshop.

If awarded the scholarship, you will be exempt from paying the registration fee for the WWCS2026. Scholarship recipients are expected to participate fully in the workshop and will provide a summary in Spanish of their experience to Fundación Sicómoro after the event.
