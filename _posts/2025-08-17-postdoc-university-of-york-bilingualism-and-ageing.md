### Department
We are looking for a highly motivated Postdoctoral Research Associate to join Dr Angela de Bruin’s research group in the Department of Psychology at the University of York. The Research Associate would be working on a project funded by the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) under the UK government’s Horizon Europe funding Guarantee for selected ERC grants, examining multilingual language control and use in younger and older adults. The current part of the project aims to understand how context, in particular the conversation partner’s language behaviour, influences how multilinguals of different ages produce and use their languages.

The position is for 24 months. The start date is flexible but would ideally be around January 2026.

### Role
Based at the University of York, you would lead the part of the project examining multilingual language production in interaction. You would work closely together with Dr Angela de Bruin and other researchers on the project. Your responsibilities include designing and setting up experiments, testing participants, analysing data, and disseminating the results through publications, conference presentations, and public engagement activities. Opportunities for mentorship and additional collaborations will be available and encouraged.

### Skills, Experience & Qualification needed
- First degree and PhD (or equivalent experience) in Psychology, Linguistics, Cognitive Neuroscience, or a related discipline
- Knowledge in experimental psychology and research techniques and methodologies, in particular knowledge of psycholinguistic research on bilingual production
- Experience of running experiments on bilingual language production, preferably including studies on language switching and/or on language alignment
- Strong communication skills, with the ability to write up and present research to a high standard. You will have strengths in individual and collaborative research skills and in the use of statistical packages (using R) to analyse complex datasets.
- Experience of independent and collaborative research, and of writing up research for publication.
- Good attention to detail, commitment to high quality research, a collaborative ethos, and enthusiasm for the research area and project. You should have a positive attitude to, and willingness to work with, colleagues and students. You should have strong planning ability, an ability to meet deadlines, and a commitment to acquiring new knowledge and skills.

Interview date: End of September (date to be confirmed)
