### Introduction
Are you a curious and motivated young researcher interested in complex systems? Are you ready to immerse yourself in an intensive 72 hours of hard work, unlimited creativity, energetic collaboration, and inspiring social exchange? Then Complexity72h is for you! Apply to our Call for Participants and help us create an unforgettable experience while developing the exciting projects proposed by our tutors (explore the projects here). Submit your application and join us next June at the Northeastern University London campus.

### What we are looking for
We seek students and early-career researchers eager to take part in an intensive, collaborative research experience. Participants will be divided into small interdisciplinary teams (6–8 people) and will work closely with tutors to develop a research project over 72 hours. When forming groups, we will make every effort to accommodate participants’ project preferences.

### Applications
Applicants should upload:
- An academic CV
- A short cover letter describing their background, interests, and motivation for participating in Complexity72h

The registration fee for each participant is 710 EUR and includes:
- Accommodation for five nights (check-in on Sunday 21 June, check-out on Friday 26 June) in a single room at the Chapter Spitalfields residence
- Workshop facilities (workplaces, rooms, wifi) at Northeastern University London
- Permanent coffee breaks and lunches during the workshop
- Three invited lectures before the 72 hours (Caldarelli, Levi, Redi)
- Social events on Sunday and Monday (still a surprise!)
- Boat tour on Thames river on Monday afternoon
