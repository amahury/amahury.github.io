### WE SEARCH FOR
The Group "Transforming Economies" at the Complexity Science Hub is looking for a postdoctoral researcher to join the project “Cities: Catalysts or roadblocks in labour market desegregation?”

Austria has recently surpassed traditional immigrant countries such as the US and Canada in terms of the relative size of its foreign-born population. Within Austria, the majority – about 40% – of people with immigrant background live in Vienna, representing 50% of the city’s population. Our project analyses how the nature and geography of workplace segregation and of professional networks in Austria have evolved in recent decades, and how workplace segregation is associated with professional networks and city size. We also study how professional networks and workplace segregation relate to workers’ job outcomes and wage progression.
