### Outline of Laboratory
RIKEN Center for Interdisciplinary Theoretical and Mathematical Sciences (iTHEMS) promotes interdisciplinary collaborations and the creation of new interdisciplinary fields through interactions among researchers in mathematics, theoretical sciences, and computational sciences. iTHEMS aims to nurture and support young scientists eager to cross disciplinary boundaries.

On April 1, 2025, iTHEMS was reorganized from a Program into a Center. iTHEMS aims to elucidate the universe, matter, and life, and to solve fundamental problems in society, using a cross-disciplinary approach centered on mathematics.

Through this call, iTHEMS is seeking Research Scientists or Postdoctoral Researchers to join the Mathematical Social Science Team and advance mathematical research aimed at deepening our understanding of collective social phenomena and contributing to the realization of a stable and sustainable society.

### Job title and Job description
- Job title: Research Scientist or Postdoctoral Researcher, a few positions
- Research Scientist: Conducts the laboratory’s research projects.
- Postdoctoral Researcher: Under the training and guidance of senior staff, conducts the laboratory’s research project, etc.

*The applicant will be assigned to an appropriate position based on his/her ability, aptitude, etc.

- Job description: iTHEMS is seeking Research Scientists or Postdoctoral Researchers who mathematically study collective social behaviors, leveraging approaches such as evolutionary game theory, network science, and agent-based simulations. We are interested in a wide range of topics, including the evolution of cooperation, the formation of social networks, and opinion dynamics, with the ultimate goal of contributing to the preservation of global commons and the realization of a sustainable society. We welcome applications from individuals who share the philosophy of iTHEMS and are eager to promote interdisciplinary research across diverse fields, including mathematics, physics, chemistry, life sciences, engineering, computational science, information science, and social sciences.

The job description may be changed during the contract period or upon contract renewal to the extent described above.

### Qualification
The candidate should possess or is expected to obtain a doctoral degree by the starting date.

### Work location
Mathematical Social Science Team, Division of Applied Mathematical Science, RIKEN Center for Interdisciplinary Theoretical and Mathematical Sciences (2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198)
