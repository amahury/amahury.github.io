The complexity school feature lectures, tutorials, and panel discussions by researchers, policymakers, representatives of NGOs, activists, and others. The primary focus of the workshop is for participants to collaboratively tackle challenges related to climate change. These can span the entire range from highly abstract modeling to solving a concrete problem such as designing a specific intervention or campaign. Project ideas are proposed on the first day by both researchers and non-academic stakeholders. The participants will work collaboratively on these projects throughout the week. While the most typical output of these projects will be research papers, we also encourage other forms of output, such as strategy papers, campaigns, or communication tools.

### Venue
Situated at the canal-front in Amsterdam’s beautiful city center, the workshop takes place at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS). Its two buildings, constructed during the 17th century in the classical Amsterdam style, are easily reached by foot and public transport from the accommodation and make a perfect starting point for exploring central Amsterdam. The IAS offers several cozy working rooms that are perfect for the team work at the workshop. In addition, the IAS offers a stimulating intellectual environment for our event with its many affiliated researchers across many disciplines, working to address fundamental and societal questions from a complexity perspetive.

### Accomodation
You will stay in 4-bed dorms including breakfast at the Generator Hostel which is located in the beautiful Oosterpark. The workshop venue at the Amsterdam Institute of Advanced Studies (IAS) can be reached from the hostel walking (30min) or with tram 14 (15min). If you live in Amsterdam or close to it and would prefer to stay at home, that is perfectly possible of course. However, the registration fee for the school remains the same. This allows us to give out more waivers for participants who cannot afford the school.
