### Program Overview
The SFI Undergraduate Complexity Research (UCR) program is a 10-week residential experience in complexity science research. Students can select from a menu of projects, or develop a project in collaboration with their mentor(s). Students learn how to combine theory, methods, and data from the physical, natural, and social sciences to ask big questions about real-world complex systems using the rigorous methods employed at SFI. Through a series of seminars and workshops, students enhance their skills as researchers and prepare for the next steps in their academic and professional journeys. 

### Dates & Times
**Program duration: June 1 – August 9, 2025**

The UCR is a full-time (all-day) commitment. All participants are expected to attend the entire program in person.

### Tuition & Fees
There is no tuition for this program. 

Students receive a stipend of $700 per week, or $7,000 over the course of the program. All UCRs are provided with housing and meals at no cost to them and travel support to/from Santa Fe, New Mexico.

Program Support   The Santa Fe Institute UCR program is supported by the National Science Foundation BIO REU (Award No. 2349052) and SFI’s generous donors — Darla Moore Foundation, McKinnon Family Foundation, and Bengier Foundation.

### Program Goals
- Explore new ideas through an independent transdisciplinary research project, guided by an SFI mentor.
- Develop a deeper understanding of complex systems research through discussions and seminars.
- Become a part of the SFI research network and connect with new colleagues and collaborators.
- Build technical and professional skills; explore diverse future career opportunities.
- Join a small, collegial, and enthusiastic UCR community who help each other succeed – even after the end of summer.
