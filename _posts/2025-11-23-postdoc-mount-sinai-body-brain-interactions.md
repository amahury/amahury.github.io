### Description
The primary research project involves understanding the role of the brain region medial amygdala in coordinating stress-related behaviors and metabolic functions.

### Responsibilities
Technical Duties:
1. Mouse stereotaxic and organ surgeries 

2. Behavioral testing 

3. Data Analysis 

4. Immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization

### Qualifications
Educational and other Requirements for the position: PhD

Experience Required: Experience in independence demonstrated through research projects 

Goals/Outcomes of the Research Project: 

The project goals are to understand the role of nutrition on stress-associated metabolic functions. Medial amygdala is an important brain site for integrating emotional information and metabolic functions. However, precisely how this occurs is not clear. First, we focus on activation and inactivation of this region on behavioral outcomes associated with fear, anxiety, feeding and sleep/wake cycle in presence of absence of nutritional changes such as high fat diet. Second, we seek to determine the neural pathways from MeA into other two important structures that are important for regulating anxiety and metabolic functions. Lastly, we seek to determine the genes and interactions of these genes in regulation of trauma and nutritional interactions. This kind of multi-level analysis allows development of foundational knowledge for several target areas, where anyone could be utilized for therapeutic development.
