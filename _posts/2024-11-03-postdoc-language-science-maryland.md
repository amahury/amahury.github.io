### General details
- Title: 	Post-Doctoral Associate
- Unit: ARHU-Dean-MD Language Science Center
- Campus/College Information: Founded in 1856, University of Maryland, College Park is the state’s flagship institution. Our 1,250-acre College Park campus is just minutes away from Washington, D.C., and the nexus of the nation’s legislative, executive, and judicial centers of power. This unique proximity to business and technology leaders, federal departments and agencies, and a myriad of research entities, embassies, think tanks, cultural centers, and non-profit organizations is simply unparalleled. Synergistic opportunities for our faculty and students abound and are virtually limitless in the nation’s capital and surrounding areas. The University is committed to attracting and retaining outstanding and diverse faculty and staff that will enhance our stature of preeminence in our three missions of teaching, scholarship, and full engagement in our community, the state of Maryland, and in the world.
- Position Summary/Purpose of Position: MLSC is home to the largest and most integrated language science community in North America, spanning 7 colleges and nearly 20 different units across the university. Researchers have ready access to relevant resources to support a range of research programs including equipment and facilities (e.g., eye-tracking, EEG, fNIRS, MEG, fMRI), state-of-art computational resources (e.g., Brendan Iribe Center for Computer Science and Engineering’s Nexus GPU cluster), and recruitment databases (e.g., Infant and Child Studies Consortium, established community partnerships). MLSC coordinates a language science research lab at the Planet Word Museum in downtown Washington, DC. UMD language scientists also benefit from close proximity to other universities (e.g. Gallaudet, Georgetown, Howard) and government research labs (e.g. NIH), in the Washington, D.C. metro area.

### Minimum Qualifications
- Education: A PhD in any relevant field, including neuroscience, psychology, linguistics, education, communication sciences and disorders, philosophy, computer science, or other cognitive science disciplines. Applicants must have formally completed all requirements of the PhD degree and provide a copy of their diploma at the time of appointment.
- Required: Applicants must submit a research statement, CV, and contact information for at least three references.
- Additional: The research statement (3-5 pages, single-spaced) should outline the applicant’s past research, a proposed plan for research during the postdoc, and how the proposed research will contribute to the applicant’s career. The statement should specifically reference at least three faculty at the University of Maryland that the applicant would be interested in working with. Applicants are strongly encouraged to reach out to potential faculty mentors to discuss potential research and collaborations prior to submitting an application. The research statement should be written for a broad audience of language scientists: the selection committee will include researchers from multiple disciplinary backgrounds, which may not include the applicant’s own field.

### Applicant Documents
1. Curriculum Vitae
2. Research (examples: research statement, research programs)
3. List of References (no emails sent from system)
