### Job description
The origin of life remains one of the greatest mysteries in science. While many theories have been proposed, no single explanation has yet gained universal agreement. That’s where the PRELIFE consortium comes in. PRELIFE unites experts across a wide range of disciplines from astronomy, biology, chemistry, computer science, earth and planetary sciences, education, mathematics, to physics. Together we will explore two fundamental questions: How did life emerge on Earth, and how common are the conditions elsewhere in the universe?

To answer these profound questions, we will take an interdisciplinary approach, bringing together diverse perspectives to unlock new insights. But we believe this question is not just for scientists, it is for everyone. That’s why we will invite teachers, students, and the public to join us, through educational programs, artistic collaborations, and museum partnerships. We’re searching for answers to life’s biggest questions, and we need your help. As part of the PRELIFE program we offer 15 exciting research projects which can be found at http://www.prelife.originscenter.nl of which the research project of the current PhD position is one.

This project aims at uncovering how the capacity for Darwinian evolution may have first arisen. While parts of this puzzle have been solved, an important open question is the emergence of information transfer (inheritance), one of the three key ingredients for Darwinian evolution. Interestingly, for evolution to function, information transfer must be near-perfect, but not flawless: with perfect replication, no variation will be generated for natural selection to act on. In this joint PhD project between the University of Groningen (promotors Prof. Martijn Egas and Prof. Rampal Etienne) and Utrecht University (co-promotor Dr. Bram van Dijk), we aim to uncover the conditions that allow near-perfect information transfer to arise from simple interactions between simple building-blocks in early prebiotic systems.

In this project, you will use computational models to explore the minimal functional requirements for self-replication to emerge from polymerising molecules. Instead of simulating specific chemistries in full detail, we will build abstract, spatially explicit models of interacting molecules to examine which properties (features of both the building blocks and the environment) enable replication with sufficient variation and inheritance. Using an open-ended model, we will explore molecular structures of life as we know it (DNA), as well as other potential polymerisation rules. These models will also help interpret and guide experiments, e.g. the stacking fiber system pioneered by Prof. Sijbren Otto at the University of Groningen.

### Qualifications
- A computational MSc degree in biology, chemistry, or physics.
- Proven affinity with evolutionary theory.
- Willingness to work in Groningen and Utrecht throughout the project (periods to be decided under mutual agreement).
- Good command of spoken and written English.
- Experience with computational modelling of artificial life is a plus, but not required.

### Conditions of employment
We offer, following the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities:
- A full-time position (1.0 FTE) of four years, but there is the possibility to work part-time (0.9 or 0.8 FTE).
- A salary of € 2,901 gross per month in the first year, up to a maximum of € 3,707 gross per month in the fourth year for a full-time working week.
- A holiday allowance of 8% gross annual income and an 8.3% year-end bonus.
- A temporary position of one year with the option of renewal for another three years. Prolongation of the contract is contingent on sufficient progress in the first year to indicate that a successful completion of the PhD thesis within the next three years is to be expected. A PhD training programme is part of the agreement and the successful candidate will be enrolled in the Graduate School of Science and Engineering.

Consider our website for more information about the working conditions at the University of Groningen: https://www.rug.nl/about-ug/work-with-us/

### Application
We invite you to submit a complete application including:
- a cover letter in which you describe your motivation and qualifications for this specific position
- a curriculum vitae
- a list with names of three references, complete with title and contact information.

You may apply for this position until 10 June 11:59pm / before 11 June 2025 Dutch local time (CEST) by means of the application form (click on "Apply" below on the advertisement on the university website).

The selection interviews will likely take place during the last week of June.
