### Minimum qualifications
- PhD degree in Computer Science, a related field, or equivalent practical experience.
- One or more scientific publication submissions for conferences, journals, or public repositories.

### Preferred qualifications
- Post-doctoral experience.
- Experience with first-authored publications in conferences or journals in physics (e.g., Physical Review Letters), programming languages (e.g., PLDI, ICFP), combinatorial optimization, or especially machine learning (e.g., ICLR, ICML, NeurIPS).
- Experience with Machine Learning.
- Excellent computer programming skills.
- Demonstrated expertise relevant to our mission: programming languages theory (e.g., rewriting systems, type systems, functional programming) or physics of complex systems.

### About the job
As an organization, Google maintains a portfolio of research projects driven by fundamental research, new product innovation, product contribution and infrastructure goals, while providing individuals and teams the freedom to emphasize specific types of work. As a Research Scientist, you'll setup large-scale tests and deploy promising ideas quickly and broadly, managing deadlines and deliverables while applying the latest theories to develop new and improved products, processes, or technologies. From creating experiments and prototyping implementations to designing new architectures, our research scientists work on real-world problems that span the breadth of computer science, such as machine (and deep) learning, data mining, natural language processing, hardware and software performance analysis, improving compilers for mobile platforms, as well as core search and much more.

As a Research Scientist, you'll also actively contribute to the wider research community by sharing and publishing your findings, with ideas inspired by internal projects as well as from collaborations with research programs at partner universities and technical institutes all over the world.

The team you'll be joining aims to advance the field of artificial intelligence by exploring alternative computational paradigms beyond those currently trending. We aim to deepen our understanding of how complexity emerges in differentiable/non-differentiable automated algorithm discovery methods. We are interested in the design of systems that, starting from a problem description, are capable of producing algorithmic solutions that exhibit compositionality, hierarchical structures, and component reuse.

### Responsibilities
- Carry out sustained exploratory research.
- Review literature, identify key questions, design experiments, and interpret results.
- Collaborate in person and remotely; maintain a respectful work environment.
- Share ideas verbally and in writing; publish and present work at journals and/or scientific conferences.
