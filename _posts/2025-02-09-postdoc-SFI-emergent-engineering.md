### About the Fellowship
The Santa Fe Institute – a private, not-for-profit theoretical research and education facility – is seeking applicants for a postdoctoral fellow in a multidisciplinary research program on Emergent Engineering. This position is based at our campuses in Santa Fe, NM. 

The modern world is defined by problems that cannot be solved with the pre-specified solutions of classic engineering. Economics, ecology, bioengineering, climate change, medicine, social policies, computer security, democratic governance and civil rights, and artificial intelligence are all classes of problems that require solutions that continually adapt, update themselves, and evolve. Emergent engineering is a new field that encompasses this category of solutions. The Santa Fe Institute seeks a postdoctoral fellow interested in working on emergent engineering either at the level of general theory and/or the detailed analysis of specific systems. Both empirical and theoretical approaches are encouraged within the program and candidates merging the two are especially encouraged to apply.

### Benefits
The successful postdoctoral candidate will work with Professors David Krakauer, Chris Kempes, and Cris Moore on a collaborative project. The goals of the project are exceptionally broad and the fellow’s expertise and past work may serve as the focus of the project. Candidates from a wide range of disciplinary backgrounds are encouraged to apply, and an interest in connecting fundamental mechanisms with societal challenges is valued. The successful candidate will also engage with the broader interdisciplinary community of researchers and postdocs at SFI. This community represents leading researchers on the study of complexity in diverse systems.

The term of this position is two years with the possibility of a third year, subject to available funding and positive annual reviews. The Institute provides discretionary and collaborative funds, a competitive salary, and a generous benefit package including a 403(b) match and paid family leave. Ideally, the chosen candidate would start during the winter or spring of 2025, but the start date is negotiable.

### Application
Please apply by uploading your CV, a 1-page research statement, the names and contact information of three professional references, and a possible start date. 

Candidates who have applied to the SFI Complexity Postdoctoral Fellowship can be considered for this position without submitting any additional materials; they should indicate their interest by emailing ariel@santafe.edu. Finalists for the position will be brought to SFI for the opportunity to present research, meet with Profs. Krakauer, Kempes and Moore, and interact with the SFI community. For additional information regarding scientific matters, email dk@santafe.edu, ckempes@santafe.edu, and moore@santafe.edu.
