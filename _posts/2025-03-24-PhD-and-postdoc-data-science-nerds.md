### Project
The project “InForM: Inference, Forecasting, and Mitigation of Future Epidemics” (InForM) is funded by the Novo Nordisk Foundation. Its goal is to develop and apply data science tool to enhance epidemic preparedness. To reach this goal, the project seeks to hire proficient PhD students and postdocs to pursue one or multiple of the following goals,
- Studying the detailed spread of COVID-19 in the Danish population during the pandemic through large-scale sequenced COVID-19 genomes and the extensive Danish collections of registers,
- Improving statistical methods used for epidemic forecasting (e.g. methods to sample and summarize ensembles of simulated epidemic trajectories),
- Simulating epidemic mitigation strategies in networked populations and studying their effectiveness and efficiency theoretically with tools including network theory, branching processes, and generating functions.

In your application, please indicate which goal(s) you are particularly interested in pursuing, and what experience and qualifications you hold that will empower your work.

The PhD(s) will be supervised by PI Jonas L Juul, Assistant Professor in Data Science at the IT University of Copenhagen (see https://jonassjuul.github.io), and Vedran Sekara, Associate Professor in Data Science at the IT University of Copenhagen.

The postdoc(s) will join Jonas L Juul’s group and will be employed for up to 3 years. We have funding to support the postdoc’s work, travel, and conference participation.

### Main responsibilities
For all the mentioned goals, responsibilities include
- Contribute to the advancement of groundbreaking research with crucial societal implications, in a highly dynamic and interdisciplinary environment,
- Coauthor scientific papers aimed at high-impact journals, participate in international conferences, and participate in advanced university classes to learn new skills,
- Work as a teaching assistant at the IT University of Copenhagen (PhDs only),
- Do a research stay in a high-quality research environment abroad (PhDs only).
- Collaborate with great collaborators with backgrounds in the computational sciences and/or health.

### Qualifications
To meet expectations, you should have the following required skills
- You have a master’s degree in Applied Mathematics, Computer Science, Data Science, Economics, Epidemiology, Physics, Statistics, or a related field.
- You are an experienced programmer, e.g. in Python,
- You have previous experience with data visualization,
- In addition, postdocs must have a Ph.D. in a relevant field at the time the postdoc position starts.

Depending on which goal you would like to pursue, experience with the following concepts will be positively evaluated: large-scale data analysis, the Danish collection of registers, causal inference, applied statistics including deep knowledge of sampling and confidence intervals, simulating disease transmission in networks, theoretical frameworks for studying contagion in populations.

### About the team
The Networks, Data and Society (NERDS) research group conducts quantitative research at the intersection of Data Science and Network Science and was recognized as the Research Environment of the Year in 2022 by the Danish Young Academy under the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters. The group has PhD students, postdocs, and faculty of many nationalities, a large network of collaborators in Denmark and abroad, and research experience from major universities in Europe and in the US. The group is a down-to-earth and fun place to work, and the IT University of Copenhagen offers a rewarding and stimulating international environment. The salary and workplace conditions are quite favorable. In Denmark, parental leave is generous, and child-care is exceptional. Find more at: https://nerds.itu.dk.
