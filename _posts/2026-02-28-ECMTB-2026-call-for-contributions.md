### General Information
We are excited to announce that both the registration for the 14th European Conference on Mathematical and Theoretical Biology (ECMTB'26) as well as the corresponding Call for Contributions are now open!

The deadline for submitting minisymposium proposals has now passed. We would like to thank all prospective organizers for their interest in hosting a minisymposium at ECMTB 2026 in Graz, Austria!

The next submission deadline is coming up soon: 15 March 2026 (AoE) for contributed talks and posters. The submission form is now open and ready for your contributions.

Visit our Call for Contributions page for all the details on how to submit your abstract for a contributed talk or poster.

We look forward to receiving your submissions!

### Call for Contributions
The 14th European Conference on Mathematical and Theoretical Biology invites submissions for minisymposia proposals, contributed talks, and poster presentations. We welcome contributions that highlight recent advances in mathematical and theoretical biology across a wide range of topics.

Contributions at ECMTB2026 are organized in the following thematic tracks:
- Cardiovascular Modelling
- Cellular and Developmental Biology
- Education and Outreach
- Immunobiology & Infection
- Mathematical Epidemiology
- Mathematical Oncology
- Multiscale and Multiphysics Modelling
- Neuroscience and Neural Systems
- Numerical, Computational, and Data-Driven Methods
- Population Dynamics, Ecology & Evolution
- Systems Biology and Biochemical Networks
- Cutting Edge Research Areas
- Miscellaneous

Proposals for either contribution type have to be submitted exclusively using our online form. The following guidelines apply to all types of contributions (minisymposia, contributed talks, and posters). Type-specific details are provided in the sections below. All proposals must include a title, an abstract (with a hard limit of 1500 characters, including spaces), and the choice of the thematic track that best fits the contribution.

Optionally, each submission may contain up to 5 bibliographic references in the Bibliography field of the submission form. The references should be added in the BibTeX format. We recommend using a tool like https://zbib.org to generate the bibliography entries. In the abstract, citations can be added using the standard \cite{ReferenceKey} command.

Proposals lacking any of the requested information or violating the guidelines will be rejected.

Contributed talks are individual 20-minute presentations (including the discussion and setup time) that will be scheduled together with other thematically adjacent talks to form a session. Poster presentations will be conducted in dedicated poster sessions, where authors can present and discuss their work with interested attendees.

In addition to the requirements outlined in the general submission guidelines above, proposals for contributed talks and posters must include all authors of the associated work (with names and affiliations), and one of the authors must be designated as the Speaker.

The scientific committee might re-evaluate the proposed format of a contribution and change it from a talk to a poster presentation.

The deadline for submitting contributed talks and poster presentations is 15. March 2026 (AoE).

### Important dates
All deadlines are to be understood as end-of-day (23:59) with respect to the Anywhere on Earth (AoE) timezone (UTC-12). This means that submissions are possible until 23:59 AoE time on the respective deadline date.
- 14/03/2026: Submission deadline for Contributed Talks and Posters
- 27/03/2026: Submission deadline for abstracts of Contributed Talks within accepted Minisymposia
- 14/04/2026: Notice of acceptance for Contributed Talks and Posters
