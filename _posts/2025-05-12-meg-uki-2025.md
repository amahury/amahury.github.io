### About
The UCL Department of Imaging Neuroscience is hosting this year’s MEG-UKI conference at the Mary Ward House in London. The event will span three days, with the first day (16th July) dedicated to naturalistic experiments, the remaining two days (17th and 18th of July) will be focused on a broad scope meeting on cutting-edge MEG methodology and application to cognitive/clinical neuroscience.

### Submission
You are invited to submit a 2500-character (~400-word) abstract by Monday 25th May 2025 at 12:00pm.

If you are submitting multiple contributions, please fill in this form multiple times.

If you submit an abstract, you will not be able to see or edit it online. Please email us at  ion.fil.reception@ucl.ac.uk, and we will amend your abstract for you. Please do not re-submit the same work.

We will inform you of your outcome week commencing 2nd June 2025.

IMPORTANT: Abstract submission does not guarantee a place at the conference. A place will only be secured by completing registration and paying the registration fee. Registration is open till 16th of June.

### Economic support
Want to attend MEG-UKI but funding is a barrier? We’re offering a limited amount of travel bursaries for presenters to help cover the cost of registration, three nights’ accommodation, and a contribution towards travel expenses.

You can apply for a bursary by emailing ion.fil.reception@ucl.ac.uk with the subject line: “MEG-UKI Travel Bursary”. As bursaries are limited, we ask applicants to include a short supporting statement (200 words or fewer) explaining how your work will positively contribute to MEG-UKI, and how it would help your professional development. Please tell us what you hope to gain from the meeting.

Successful applicants will be notified during the week following abstract acceptance notifications.

Please note: these bursaries are intended for those who would otherwise be unable to attend MEG-UKI. If you have access to funding but apply for a bursary, you may be taking a place from someone who truly needs the support.
