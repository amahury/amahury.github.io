Princeton University is seeking to hire AI Postdoctoral Research Fellows to join the Natural and Artificial Minds (NAM) AI Lab research initiative. NAM Fellows will take advantage of advances in AI to study natural and artificial minds in parallel, creating the opportunity to make discoveries about ourselves and to find new ways to understand and improve AI systems. AI Postdoctoral Research Fellows will have access to the AI Lab GPU cluster (300 H100s). Candidates should have recently received or be about to receive a Ph.D. or doctorate degree in cognitive science, psychology, computer science, philosophy, or a related discipline, and have a strong interest and track record in designing, understanding, or engineering of AI models or methods and their applications in cognitive science. 

AI Postdoctoral Research Fellows joining the NAM initiative will contribute to one or both current core projects, "Explanation and Intelligibility" or "Developing and Testing AI Models of Human Cognitive Function." Candidates can read more about these core projects at https://ai.princeton.edu/nam#core.


AI Postdoctoral Research Fellows will be appointed through the Princeton Laboratory for Artificial Intelligence (the AI Lab) and will receive a competitive salary, benefits, office and equipment, compute resources, and yearly research support. Appointments are for one year with the possibility of renewal pending satisfactory performance and continued funding. Candidates are encouraged to apply by the start-of-review date, December 31, 2024 to guarantee consideration, but some applications may be screened and processed before or after that at our discretion.

Postdoctoral requirements:
- Princeton University places high value on in-person collaborations and interactions, and we expect selected candidates to participate in-person.
- Ph.D. is expected.
- The work location for this position is in-person on campus at Princeton University.

Applicants must apply online at https://www.princeton.edu/acad-positions/position/36506 and submit a current curriculum vitae, research statement, and a cover letter. Contact information for three references is required.
