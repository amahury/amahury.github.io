### Special Issue Information
Dear Colleagues, 

Understanding the biological organization from non-algorithmic mathematical models is one of the most important fields in mathematical biology. However, biological thinking in this century witnessed the overwhelming use of the algorithmic and syntactic mathematics, that cannot deal with the autopoietic self-referential organization of living systems. Algorithmic simulations not only misplaced the mathematical foundations of biology and its diverse areas such as genetics, cell biology, immunology, neurobiology, ecology, evolution, earth system and cognitive science, but also fostered the computational tool as the only method to encoding biological causality.

What is evident, even from the most basic process at the molecular level, is that algorithmic and computational biology is limited to explain processes and forms of living system such as, for example, the ‘protein-folding problem’. Therefore, if difficulties are already encountered at this level, it is to be expected that cellular, ecological or cognitive processes are even more distant from having algorithmic referents.

Therefore, in order to address the multiple scales and realizations of living systems autopoietic organization, it is necessary to develop or extend the comprehension of non-algorithmic mathematical models such as the (M,R)-system that on the one hand incorporate the right expression of causality for biological organization and on the other hand leverage both the increasing modelling power of category theory, calculus of indications or algebraic biology.

We welcome articles, reviews, communications, hypothesis, essays and opinions that aim to advance the use of the (M,R)-system and other non-algorithmic mathematical models in the understanding of the causality of biological systems organization involving self-fabrication -autopoiesis- and hence cognition, autonomy and anticipation and the fundamental differences with respect of artificial systems and non-biological systems. We welcome articles related to any of these topics:

- Categorical and indicational models of the causality of biological organization;
- Modelling relation between autopoietic and (M,R)-systems;
- Formal and causal differences of biological and non-biological systems;
- Cognition, autonomy, anticipation and self-reference in the causal organization of biological systems;
- Scales of realization or instantiation of autopoietic and (M,R)-systems;
- Novel non-algorithmic mathematical methods to study biological organization.

### Manuscript Submission Information
Manuscripts should be submitted online at www.mdpi.com by registering and logging in to this website. Once you are registered, click here to go to the submission form. Manuscripts can be submitted until the deadline. All submissions that pass pre-check are peer-reviewed. Accepted papers will be published continuously in the journal (as soon as accepted) and will be listed together on the special issue website. Research articles, review articles as well as short communications are invited. For planned papers, a title and short abstract (about 100 words) can be sent to the Editorial Office for announcement on this website.

Submitted manuscripts should not have been published previously, nor be under consideration for publication elsewhere (except conference proceedings papers). All manuscripts are thoroughly refereed through a single-blind peer-review process. A guide for authors and other relevant information for submission of manuscripts is available on the Instructions for Authors page. Mathematics is an international peer-reviewed open access semimonthly journal published by MDPI.

Please visit the Instructions for Authors page before submitting a manuscript. The Article Processing Charge (APC) for publication in this open access journal is 2600 CHF (Swiss Francs). Submitted papers should be well formatted and use good English. Authors may use MDPI's English editing service prior to publication or during author revisions.

### Benefits of Publishing in a Special Issue
- Ease of navigation: Grouping papers by topic helps scholars navigate broad scope journals more efficiently.
- Greater discoverability: Special Issues support the reach and impact of scientific research. Articles in Special Issues are more discoverable and cited more frequently.
- Expansion of research network: Special Issues facilitate connections among authors, fostering scientific collaborations.
- External promotion: Articles in Special Issues are often promoted through the journal's social media, increasing their visibility.
- e-Book format: Special Issues with more than 10 articles can be published as dedicated e-books, ensuring wide and rapid dissemination.
