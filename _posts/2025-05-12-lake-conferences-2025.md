Join the Allen Institute and Circuit Neuroscience Basel for the Lake Conference in Seattle, Washington this September! This small conference will bring together researchers for engaging presentations and discussions of cutting-edge research and time for networking.

The 3.5 day conference will focus on neural coding and dynamics at the brain-wide level, their implementation in evolved neural circuits, and the impact of theory and machine learning in understanding the brain.

### Modality
The scientific program will include 33 talks by invited speakers, organizer-selected short talks from participants, and two poster sessions. The study of neural coding and dynamics has recently been turbocharged by advances in experimental methods and a revolution in computing and modeling. It is now becoming possible to test long-standing theoretical models of how the dynamic interactions of populations of neurons process information and produce intelligent behavior.

The conference will bring together leaders in the field with early-career researchers for a highly interactive meeting.

### Application
We invite applicants at all career stages to apply to attend. Application window will be open until May 23. In addition to speaker presentations, we will feature a number of short talks and posters from accepted applicants. Acceptance does not guarantee a short talk time slot, those elected will be notified. All applicants will be notified of the decision on their applications in June.

### Registration
The conference registration fee is $650 USD for a general ticket and $550 for students, to be paid only by accepted applicants after notification. Application is free. Registration includes:
- Three days of conference sessions
- Welcome reception (Sunday, 9/28) & midday event (Tuesday, 9/30)
- All meals during the conference
- Please contact events@alleninstitute.org with questions.

### Venue
The conference will take place at the Hyatt Regency Lake Washington hotel in Renton, WA. Located on the south shores of Lake Washington, the Hyatt Regency combines modern meeting spaces and guest rooms with unparalleled access to the beauty of the Pacific Northwest.

The hotel is a convenient 10 minutes from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and just 20 minutes from downtown Seattle. The hotel can be reached by public transport, taxis, sea plane and kayak!
