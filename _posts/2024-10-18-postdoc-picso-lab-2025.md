### Details of the current opening:
We are pleased to announce a two-year postdoctoral position in network modeling of social dynamic systems at the University of Pittsburgh's School of Computing and Information. The successful candidate will be part of a project focused on developing a combined framework of complex network and socio-cognitive theories.

### Key Duties:
The position involves the modeling and simulation of dynamical systems, as well as the analysis of massive behavioral and network data.

### Qualifications:
We are seeking candidates who have:
- A completed Ph.D.
- An interest in transdisciplinary research,
- Proficient technical skills, specifically in dynamic network modeling, which includes but is not limited to: multilayer network approaches, Bayesian inference analyses, stochastic epidemic modeling, and modeling of opinion formation and information diffusion.

Ideal candidates would have their research contribute to the fields of network science, complex systems, statistical modeling, control optimization, computational social science, applied mathematics, or other related fields.

The postdoctoral researcher will join the Pitt Computational Social Dynamic (PICSO) Lab, under the guidance of Dr. Yu-Ru Lin.

### Application Process:
Interested applicants may apply using the provided form. The candidate selection process will start immediately, and we are looking to fill the position as soon as possible.
