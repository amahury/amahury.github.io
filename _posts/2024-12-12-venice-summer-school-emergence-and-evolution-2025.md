### About the school
Biological systems comprise multiple levels of organization, from molecules, organelles, and cells, to the multi-cellular structures that form whole tissues, organisms, and ultimately societies and ecosystems. During organismal development, these levels emerge from the dynamic interactions of system components and give rise to complex structures and functions across scales. Similarly, over the course of evolution, the emergence of phenotypes involves more than the transmission of genetic material, as selection works at all levels to generate novel phenotypes. However, we are only at the beginning of understanding how such levels of organization can emerge de novo in evolution or how levels self-organize and feed back on one another during growth and development. This is no simple task, as studying these fundamental questions in evolution and development requires quantification and modeling approaches that cross biological scales, alongside conceptual frameworks for understanding dynamical systems and emergent phenomena.

To tackle the issue, we need novel, empirically grounded, systems-biology theories that integrate philosophical, mathematical, and experimental approaches across biological scales. During our lecture course, we will look at the emergence and evolution of multi-level regulatory systems from an interdisciplinary theoretical vantage point to assess the requirements, mechanisms, and consequences of multi-level phenomena.

Specifically, we will focus on the following four questions:
- How do new levels of organization (molecular, organelle, cellular, tissue, organismal, and beyond) originate and integrate in development and evolution?
- What is the nature of causal-mechanistic interactions between levels of organization?
- How do we measure and manipulate biological systems across multiple scales?
- How can we model feedback interactions across different levels of organization in regulatory systems?

Over recent years, it has become increasingly evident that dynamical processes, mechanical and physical forces, signaling feedback, and metabolic constraints play critical roles in patterning and coordinating emergent phenotypes. In addition, systems biology and metabolomics approaches, along with single-cell quantification of live or fixed samples, have revolutionized how we can empirically study emergent phenomena. Computational modeling and dynamical systems approaches have shed light on how network components and interactions can lead to spatial and temporal patterning, division of labor, and increased complexity and integration above the level of cells. A synthesis of these interdisciplinary approaches can now allow us to refine and develop new conceptual frameworks for understanding the mechanisms, and consequences, of multi-level processes in evolution and development.

### Registration
- Registration Deadline: 31 March 2025
- Abstract Submission Deadline: 31 March 2025
- Chosen Participants Will Be Notified By 30 April 2025
- Payment Deadline: 31 May 2025

Registration is all-inclusive and covers:
- Accommodation in shared double rooms at the Centro Culturale Don Orione Artigianelli close to the famous Accademia bridge and museum in Venice, at the same location the lectures take place.
- Breakfast and lunch, coffee breaks, plus a welcome dinner on Monday evening (dinner on the other days of the course is self-provided).

### Selection criteria
Applications should include a short academic CV, motivation letter, and a mini-abstract for the elevator pitch (the last not mandatory, only for those who would like to present one).

Applicants will be chosen mainly based on their stated motivation and interest in the topics of the course. The CV will be consulted to ensure that the applicant has the required background to be able to follow the course. The research abstract is not mandatory and not part of the selection procedure.

### Abstract guidelines
Abstracts for elevator pitches should be no longer than 100 words and clearly summarize the research project of the participant (which does not have to be directly related to the topic of the course, but if a connection exists, please mention it).

The abstract should be accessible to researchers with a broad range of backgrounds, from experimental biology, to mathematical modeling, to the philosophy of science.

Elevator pitches will be limited to a duration of 2 – 3 min, and a maximum of 2 slides (only if necessary for the presentation). The aim of the elevator pitch session is to acquaint the participants with each others’ research interests at the beginning of the course.

### Travel grants and registration fee waivers
Travel grants and registration fee waivers are available for participants.

Selection of awardees is handled directly by the organizers. EMBO travel grants and registration fee waivers are allocated on the basis of the quality of the submitted abstract.

Applicants do not need to apply separately for these but should indicate on the registration form if they wish to be considered.

Additional travel grants are available for EMBC Associate Member States Chile, India, Singapore and Taiwan.
