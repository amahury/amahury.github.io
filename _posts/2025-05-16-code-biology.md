description: Since 2003, Marcello Barbieri has been suggesting that there are two distinct mechanisms of evolutionary change—evolution by natural selection, based on copying, and evolution by natural conventions, based on coding. Today I am going to briefly review his Code Biology, a branch of theoretical biology focused on the study of all codes of life, from the genetic code to the codes of culture.

### Introduction
The concept of a [code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code) is fundamentally characterized as a set of rules establishing correspondences between elements of two independent domains—mapping signs onto meanings. Codes are pervasive in biology, evidenced by the existence of the [genetic code](https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Genetic-Code), [signal transduction codes](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4020-6340-4_12), [metabolic code](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.169570), [sequence codes](https://nyaspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1749-6632.1999.tb08894.x), [histone code](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12304-014-9211-2), [sugar code](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/The+Sugar+Code%3A+Fundamentals+of+Glycosciences-p-9783527320899), [splicing codes](https://www.cell.com/fulltext/S0092-8674(04)01107-9), [compartment codes](https://www.ndl.ethernet.edu.et/bitstream/123456789/12871/1/Marcello%20Barbieri.pdf), [cytoskeleton code](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4020-6340-4#page=202), [tubulin code](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cm.21290), [nuclear signaling code](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4020-6340-4_9), [injective organic codes](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12304-014-9210-3), [molecular codes](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0054694), [ubiquitin code](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-biochem-060310-170328), [bioelectric code](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.4161/cib.22595), and [glycomic code](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12155-014-9460-6), among others. The ubiquity of biological codes has led to the development of [biosemiotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosemiotics), a discipline historically rooted in [Peircean semiotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotic_theory_of_Charles_Sanders_Peirce). However, the emergence of [Code Biology](https://www.codebiology.org/) marked a significant theoretical divergence, notably influenced by [Marcello Barbieri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcello_Barbieri)’s insights. 

Historically, the recognition that the genetic code lacks deterministic chemical necessity, allowing any [codon](https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Codon) to associate arbitrarily with any [amino acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid), poses a fundamental ontological question: how do arbitrary rules emerge and evolve in nature? Addressing this enigma becomes essential for understanding biological organization and the evolution of life on primitive Earth, and such a question is the main focus of code biology. Today I will give a brief introduction to this science, discussing its motivations and its relationship with biosemiotics.

### Code Biology
Historically, the emergence of the genetic code involved three distinct [RNA types](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/mcat/biomolecules/x04f6bc56:transcription-and-translation/a/types-of-rna)—ribosomal, transfer, and messenger RNAs—whose interactions created a codon-amino acid mapping apparatus. Initially, this mapping was ambiguous, generating statistical rather than specific proteins. Evolution, thus, refined the genetic code via two separate mechanisms: reducing ambiguity and minimizing translation errors. Ribosomal proteins illustrate this evolutionary principle, functioning effectively despite variability in their specific molecular composition. Thus, the significance of code evolution lies not in the specificity of individual codon assignments, but in [collective relationships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_behavior) among molecular components.

Further evolutionary complexity arose with the transition from RNA-based synthetases to modern [protein-based synthetases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aminoacyl_tRNA_synthetase), a shift reflecting an error-minimization strategy rather than an entirely novel evolutionary mechanism. Consequently, two evolutionary phases emerged: first, ambiguity reduction oriented toward ribosomal protein diversification; second, optimization toward efficient translation machinery, resulting in highly precise protein synthesis. [Signal transduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_transduction) codes further illustrate evolutionary significance. These codes, independent of genetic codification, mediated the transition from statistical cellular responses to specific behaviors, marking the emergence of the first modern cells. 

Given the explanation above, Barbieri [emphasizes](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystems.2017.10.005) that the origin of life was not fundamentally autopoietic (self-creating) but “codepoietic”—based upon generating and conserving organic codes. Hence, “codepoiesis” characterizes life's essential logic more accurately than [autopoiesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopoiesis). To me this idea resonates with the semantic closure proposed by [Pattee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_H._Pattee), the idea that a system, whether it's a language, a computer program, or even a cognitive model, can contain within itself the ability to define and manipulate its own meaning and rules. Both code biology and biosemiotics consider the capacity of a system to be self-referential and self-explanatory, regarding its own structure and operation, as fundamental in the origin of life. But what is biosemiotics?

### Biosemiotics
Marcello Barbieri’s [subsequent work](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13752-018-0312-z) elucidates the theoretical distinctions between Code Biology and Peircean biosemiotics. Central to this distinction is the conceptualization of meaning: Code Biology attributes meaning directly to coding processes, whereas Peircean biosemiotics ascribes meaning to interpretative processes involving [abduction](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-030-68436-5_8-2). Organic codes are physically realized through adaptors—molecular entities like tRNAs—confirming a genuine biological code's presence.

Biosemiotics, following [Thomas Sebeok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Sebeok) and [Charles Sanders Peirce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sanders_Peirce), posits that interpretation extends to cellular processes, claiming that decoding processes equate to interpretation. Barbieri counters this perspective, emphasizing fundamental distinctions between coding (adaptor-mediated) and interpretation (context-dependent). Interpretation as a biological phenomenon, Barbieri argues, is confined to behavioral contexts, distinct from molecular decoding. In Barbieri's words: _“This means that a reconciliation of Code Biology with Peircean biosemiotics is possible only if it is shown that a genuine process of interpretation takes place inside the cell.”_

Robert Rosen’s relational biology [has been proposed](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13752-018-0302-1) to bridge these frameworks. Rosen’s [relational biology](https://ahlouie.com/relational-biology/) aligns with Code Biology by emphasizing functional relations within biological systems, thereby providing [theoretical grounds](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03081078608934929) for potential reconciliation between coding and interpretation. Nevertheless, significant conceptual distinctions persist, particularly regarding interpretative mechanisms at the molecular versus organismal levels. Despite this, as mentioned by Barbieri, it is clear that a reconciliation of Code Biology with Peircean biosemiotics is possible only if it is shown that a genuine process of interpretation takes place inside the cell.

### Evolution and Codes of Life
Beyond explaining life’s origin via biological codes, Code Biology proposes a new perspective to study evolutionary stepping stones. Ádám Kun’s [analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303264721001921) places biological codes within the broader context of [major evolutionary transitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Major_Transitions_in_Evolution) (METs), characterized by shifts in individuality and novel information inheritance systems. METs involve either the formation of new evolutionary units or substantial informational transformations without necessarily forming new individuals. According to Kun, codes of life defined by their abrupt emergence (discontinuity), invariance, additive nature, stability, and increasing complexity, invariably precede and facilitate these major evolutionary transitions.

Throughout his paper, Kun delineates examples such as the genetic code's emergence, chromosome formation, mitochondria and plastid integration into eukaryotic cells, multicellularity, and human language evolution. He emphasizes that codes themselves are not METs, but essential enablers. For instance, code ambiguity elimination was instrumental for establishing biological specificity, paving the way for new evolutionary possibilities. Later, our human ability to develop communication systems triggered a host of technological revolutions that brought us to where we are today. 

### Conclusion
Code Biology provides critical insights into life's complexity, emphasizing coding's central role in biological evolution and innovation. However, unresolved questions remain, particularly regarding how molecular coding relates to broader interpretative processes at organismal and cultural levels. Further research into Rosen’s relational biology could clarify relationships between Code Biology and Biosemiotics, enhancing theoretical coherence across biological scales. 

While Code Biology has significantly advanced our understanding of biological complexity and evolutionary processes, integrating molecular coding principles with broader interpretative phenomena continues to pose both theoretical and empirical challenges. Addressing these issues promises a deeper comprehension of life's fundamental logic, thereby enriching biological theory and practice.
