description: We are pleased to invite submissions for the Asia-Pacific Conference on Networks and Complex Systems 2026, whose goal is to provide more opportunities for Asia-Pacific scientists in network science and complex systems science to share their works, and also to encourage more intense interactions with scientists from other parts of the world.

### About the Conference
The number of scientists working on networks and complex systems in the Asia-Pacific region is increasing, but high-level conferences in these areas remain limited to NetSci, NetSciX, the International Conference on Computational Science (ICCS), and Conference on Complex Systems (CCS). Asia-Pacific scientists, especially postdocs and PhD students in these areas therefore have limited opportunities to attend these conferences. This leads to a lack of exposure of Asia-Pacific scientists to good work done elsewhere in the world, and of scientists from other parts of the world to good work done in Asia-Pacific, and seriously hampers the academic growths of Asia-Pacific scientists. Recently, we have been encouraged by the strong turnout of Indian scientists at all levels at the NetSciX 2025 conference in Indore, India. We can sense that the younger scientists treasured this opportunity to share their work. Unfortunately, it is impossible to bring these flagship conferences to Asia-Pacific every year. At best, we can host one such conference in Asia once every three to four years.

This prompted us to start an Asia-Pacific Conference on Networks and Complex Systems beginning next year (2-5 Jun 2026 in Singapore) to cater to these unmet demands. With this conference, we would always have a platform to present our recent work and meet up with colleagues. While we will always invite the most exciting speakers from all around the world, our goal is to include more invited speakers from Asia-Pacific. We also aim to give as many participants as possible (including PhD students) a chance to give oral presentations. We will rotate this conference series around Asia-Pacific, where most venues are more affordable compared to Europe or North America. Hopefully, more Asian scientists would be able to attend, even if they have limited funding. This is especially true of PhD students and postdoctoral researchers, many of whom can only attend the local editions of the conference.

Finally, to ensure that the conference is relevant and high-level, we will be advised by an International Advisory Committee of eminent scientists in the fields of networks and complex systems. Additionally, to ensure that good organizational practices are shared after they are developed, besides local organizers the organizing team for a given year will also comprise core members from the organizing team for the next year.

### Call for Abstracts
Submissions should be in the form of two-page extended abstracts containing the titles of the talks, the lists of authors and their affiliations, and paragraphs on the motivations behind the studies, the approaches and methodologies, the key results, and the conclusions and outlooks.

For each abstract, the motivation paragraph should include a brief survey of the research topic, the research questions being asked, and why the answers to these questions are important. The approach and methodology paragraph should succinctly summarize how the study was carried out, and why certain methods are used. The results paragraph should summarize only the key results, and whether and which research questions they answer. This should then be followed by one or two short summary statements in the conclusions and outlook paragraph, as well as additional studies likely to be completed by the time of the conference.

The extended abstract must include a short list of references, but should also take advantage of the second page to include figures on the research questions, the methods, and the results, with appropriate cross referencing in the text. For studies involving humans and animals, we ask for an ethics statement to be included at the end of the abstract.

Please use the templates provided for Word or LaTeX.

### Submission Guidelines
Submission opens on 1 Dec 2025, and will close on 28 Feb 2026. The abstract should be written in English, using a suitable 12-point font, on an A4-size document with one-inch margins, and submitted through email to SPMS-APCNCS2026@ntu.edu.sg.

The use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) for research, i.e., for statistical sampling from a probabilistic model is acceptable. How this is done should be mentioned in the approach and methodology paragraph. The use of GenAI for editorial support, i.e., check for grammatical errors or typographical errors, as well as for clarity in the writing is also acceptable. Contributing authors should exercise human oversight on the submitted version, to ensure that the GenAI suggested edits are aligned with their original intents.
