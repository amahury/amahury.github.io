### General info
CCS will host several satellite sessions for 2 days during the conference. These satellites will be a full, or a half-day session on a well-defined topic within the framework of the Complex Systems Society. Successful satellite applications will be asked to organise and manage their sessions through their own committees.

The satellite organisers are responsible for reviewing proposed papers and working with their presenters. Coffee breaks and lunch will be provided by the CCS organisers.

Organisers of a Satellite will be given 1 satellite-only waived registration fee for CCS25 that could be used to cover the participation of either an invited speaker to the satellite or any other participant/organizerS.

### Relevant topics
Topics covered by the conference include, but are not limited to:
- Foundations of Complex Systems
- Information and communication technologies
- Machine learning and AI for complex systems
- Cognition and language
- Economics and finance
- Infrastructure, planning, and the environment
- Energy, sustainability, and climate change
- Science of cities and mobility
- Complexity in biology and health sciences
- Socio-economic systems
- Complexity in physics and chemistry
- Other applications of complex systems
