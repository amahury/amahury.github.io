### General Info
- Journal: Philosophy of AI
- Deadline for Submission: August 31, 2025

While conventional digital computers have been the state of the art in AI for at least the last seven decades, a new paradigm is emerging. With Moore’s law coming to an end, computer engineering has turned its attention towards chips that work with mechanisms analogous to those in the brain. So-called neuromorphic hardware consists of physical “neurons” interconnected via “synapses”; it promises to reduce the power consumption of large AI models by two orders of magnitude, thus potentially replacing digital AI implementations within the next few decades. Philosophy is only now starting to consider the potential implications of hardware structures that replicate aspects of the neural mechanisms in the mammalian brain. This special issue is a platform for interdisciplinary researchers to foster the debate on the philosophical implications as well as the potential risks and benefits of the use of neuromorphic technologies.

### Topics of Interest
We welcome papers that engage with the following topics, among others:
- Can neuromorphic hardware support neural representations?
- Do neuromorphic chips enable neural experiments by building, rather than simulating, neural networks?
- How relevant is energy efficiency to computational neuroscience, given its evolutionary advantage in biological systems?
- In what ways does learning in neuromorphic systems resemble or differ from neural learning in biological systems?
- Is neuromorphic computation relevant for computational explanation in contemporary neuroscience?
- Are neuromorphic chips more likely or more capable to implement artificial consciousness than conventional chips?
- How should we evaluate the predictions of theories of consciousness such as Integrated Information Theory regarding neuromorphic hardware?
- Are there ethical constraints on building brain-like systems?

### Contributors
We are pleased to announce that the following scholars have already agreed to contribute to this special issue:
- Mazviita Chirimuuta
- Wanja Wiese
- Peter Grindrod
- Inês Hipólito
- Derek Shiller

### Submission Guidelines
- There is no strict word limit. Ideally, manuscripts should be around 8,000 words, prepared in accordance with the journal's formatting guidelines (the use of a reference manager and APA is strongly encouraged).
- Submissions should be original and not under consideration for publication elsewhere.
- All submissions will undergo peer-review.

How to Submit: Please submit your manuscripts through the journal's online submission system (https://journals.ub.uni-koeln.de/index.php/poai/about/submissions). Make sure to indicate that the paper is intended for the "Philosophy of Neuromorphic AI" special issue. Papers should be prepared for blind review.

### Important Dates
- Submission Deadline: August 31, 2025
- Papers will be published on a rolling basis as soon as they are accepted.
