The project is part of a larger effort on examining mechanisms for compositionality in intelligent and adaptive systems, funded by the Templeton World Charity Foundation.  This larger effort is focused on how intelligent behavior emerges from complex systemsâ€”in particular, the mechanisms by which semi-independent, adaptive processes are composed to function as an intelligent, higher-level whole.  The models we develop will be inspired, in large part, by the compositional processes underlying visual reasoning in human cognition.
