### Introduction
Dear Colleagues,

Complex systems, which are prevalent in nature and human society, exhibit fascinating emergent behaviors, e.g., phase transition, synchronization, clustering, chimeras, nonlinear waves, and swarming dynamics. Understanding the mechanism embedded in these behaviors is crucial for various fields, including physics, biology, and engineering.

This Special Issue aims to bring together researchers to explore the emergent dynamics of complex systems, focusing on the dynamics and statistical physics of synchronization, clustering, and swarming phenomena.

We invite submissions that investigate the underlying mechanisms, mathematical models, and real-world applications related to these topics. We are interested in a wide range of research areas, such as the synchronization of coupled oscillators, the formation of clusters in social and biological networks, and the swarming dynamics of active particles. Both theoretical and empirical studies are welcome. We also encourage interdisciplinary approaches that combine methods from different disciplines to provide new insights into the emergent dynamics of complex systems.

Manuscripts should be original and not under consideration for publication elsewhere. We invite authors to submit full-length research articles, review papers, and short communications. For more information, please visit the journalâ€™s website or contact the Guest Editors.

We look forward to receiving your contributions and, together, advancing our understanding of emergent dynamics in complex systems.

Prof. Dr. Zhigang Zheng

Guest Editor

### Submission Guidelines
Manuscripts should be submitted online at www.mdpi.com by registering and logging in to this website. Once you are registered, click here to go to the submission form. Manuscripts can be submitted until the deadline. All submissions that pass pre-check are peer-reviewed. Accepted papers will be published continuously in the journal (as soon as accepted) and will be listed together on the special issue website. Research articles, review articles as well as short communications are invited. For planned papers, a title and short abstract (about 100 words) can be sent to the Editorial Office for announcement on this website.

Submitted manuscripts should not have been published previously, nor be under consideration for publication elsewhere (except conference proceedings papers). All manuscripts are thoroughly refereed through a single-blind peer-review process. A guide for authors and other relevant information for submission of manuscripts is available on the Instructions for Authors page. Entropy is an international peer-reviewed open access monthly journal published by MDPI.

Please visit the Instructions for Authors page before submitting a manuscript. The Article Processing Charge (APC) for publication in this open access journal is 2600 CHF (Swiss Francs). Submitted papers should be well formatted and use good English. Authors may use MDPI's English editing service prior to publication or during author revisions.
