### Job Description
Welcome to Maastricht University! Here, you contribute to education and research that help make sense of the evolving political landscape in Europe and beyond. You join an international academic community where critical thinking, collaboration, and curiosity drive everything we do — and where your philosophical perspective helps students and colleagues engage thoughtfully with today’s most pressing democratic challenges.

- Our goal: Strengthen our research and teaching in political philosophy, with a focus on inequality in contemporary European democracies.
- Your colleagues: A diverse and international group of philosophers working across political philosophy, philosophy of technology, and philosophy of art and culture at the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences (FASoS).

The department of philosophy at Maastricht University is looking for an Assistant Professor in political philosophy, with a research focus on inequality in contemporary European democracies. We are searching for someone enthusiastic about connecting normative theory with real-world challenges, working across disciplinary boundaries, and contributing to collaborative research.

You have a research profile in contemporary political philosophy or political theory. You contribute to normative and conceptual debates about inequality in contemporary European democracies and the interaction between different dimensions of such inequality (e.g. social, cultural, economic, and political). Potential focal points of your contribution may include but are by no means limited to theorizing (responses to) the challenges posed to contemporary democracies by concentrated economic power, precarization, the resurgence of inegalitarian political ideologies, and the political economy of financialized capitalism. You are capable of connecting your normative and conceptual research to empirical scholarship.

You will join our “Europe: Society, Politics, and Global Order” research programme. You will teach across our BA and MA degree programmes. You will also be part of the Dutch national-level humanities and social sciences sector plan “Societal Inequality and Diversity”, in which you liaise with colleagues from other traditions of inquiry, such as qualitative social research or psychology.

### What you do
- Engage in field-leading research in political philosophy, publishing in international journals, presenting at conferences and organising research activities within the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences.
- Deliver top-quality education through co-teaching and coordinating courses; supervising BA and MA students in their theses and leading student research projects
- Apply for external research funding at the national and European level.
- Actively collaborate with colleagues from across departments in interdisciplinary teaching and research activities.

### What you bring
- A PhD in political philosophy, political theory or social philosophy or a closely related field.
- A growing publication record, appropriate to your career stage, in internationally recognized venues.
- Experience teaching and supervising students at undergraduate level, and ideally at the graduate (MA) level.
- Excellent command of English (C1 level) and the ability to teach in English.
- A collaborative mindset and enthusiasm for interdisciplinary education and research.
- Willingness to obtain the Dutch University Teaching Qualification (UTQ) and to acquire Dutch language skills up to B1 level within three years.

Candidates from under-represented groups in academia and philosophy are particularly encouraged to apply.

### What we offer
At Maastricht University, you’ll work in an international, open, and engaged environment. We offer:
- An 18-month contract with the prospect of a permanent contract, subject to positive assessment.
- A gross monthly salary between €4.728 and €6.433 (based on full-time employment of 38 hours per week).
- 8% holiday allowance and an 8.3% year-end bonus.
- 29 vacation days (based on full-time), four additional days off (Carnival Monday and Tuesday, Good Friday, and Liberation Day), and the possibility to accrue up to 12 extra days through compensation hours.
- Flexible working hours, a home office allowance, and options for hybrid working.
- The freedom and space to shape your work independently and develop your ideas.
- A close-knit community of colleagues committed to support, collaboration, and innovation.
- A solid pension scheme through ABP, company fitness arrangements, and access to extensive university sports facilities.
- An inspiring work environment in the heart of Europe.

### About the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences (FASoS)
FASoS is a close-knit, international scholarly community. We provide interdisciplinary education in the humanities and social sciences across four main BA/MA pillars: Arts and Culture, European Studies, Digital Society, and Global Studies/Development. Our research focuses on social, political, and cultural change across four interdisciplinary programmes: Europe: Society, Politics, and Global Order (ESPO), Maastricht University Science, Technology, and Society Studies (MUSTS), Globalization, Transnationalism, and Development (GTD), and Arts, Media, and Culture (AMC) — with room to grow, explore, and shape your own academic path.

### About the Department
