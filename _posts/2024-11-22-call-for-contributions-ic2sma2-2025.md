### General info
The International Conference on Computer Science, Mathematics, and Applied Applications (ICCSMAA) is an annual conference that brings together researchers, academics, and industry professionals from around the world to discuss the latest developments in computer science, mathematics, and applied applications. The conference provides a platform for researchers to present their work, exchange ideas, and collaborate on new projects. ICCSMAA covers a wide range of topics, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, data science, cybersecurity, and more. The conference features keynote speakers, technical sessions, workshops, and social events, providing attendees with a unique opportunity to learn, network, and engage with the global research community.

IC2SMA2 2025 aims to create a new international venue that can unite scholars, practitioners and students from diverse fields to address various real-world challenges and opportunities using methodologies of complex systems modeling and analysis. The conference will showcase cutting-edge modeling/analysis methods, interdisciplinary applications, and innovative solutions, fostering collaboration and sparking new ideas. Its inaugural 2025 edition will have a particular focus on the applications to education and society. By integrating insights from systems science, mathematics, computer science, engineering, economics, social sciences, psychology, healthcare, education, and many others, we seek to advance understanding and application in these crucial areas. Join us to explore how multidisciplinary approaches can drive improvements in our society!

Organized in Hybrid Mode by CHRIST University, Pune Lavasa, India & Binghamton University, State University of New York, USA.
