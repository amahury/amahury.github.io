description: Junior professorships are a new form of recruitment based on a research and teaching project, at the end of the pre-tenure contract, and after an assessment of the scientific value and professional aptitude of the successful candidate (M/F) for the chair by a committee, the candidate will have direct access without competition (subject to a favourable assessment) to a permanent post in the body of university professors (Decree no. 2021-1710 of 17 December 2021).

### General Info
- Faculty and department: Faculty of science and technology, Mathematics Department
- Laboratory: Centre de Physique Théorique (CPT)
- Workplace: Toulon University – La Garde campus
- Starting date: 1st October 2025
- Contract duration: 4 years
- Gross monthly salary: Beetween 3726 et 4345 euros
- Teaching profile: The professor will work within the Faculty of Science and Technology at the
University of Toulon, teaching pure and applied mathematics from bachelor's to
master's degrees. In particular, he/she will be able to propose new courses for the
next habilitation, previously tested either as optional courses or in the international
universities he/she will have visited in order to set up international agreements.
He/she will be keen to develop teaching at Master's level related to dynamical
systems, rigorous statistical physics and inverse problems or spectral theory,
which could resonate with his/her research project and help attract students for
internships or PhDs. He/she could also be a driving force behind the organization of thematic schools
(such as summer schools).
- Research profile: The scientific project revolves around the theme of controlling systems of many
independent units, i.e. a school of underwater drones. These systems can be seen
as active particles, breaking the action-reaction principle of mechanics and
profoundly changing the nature of statistical physics approaches. How can such a
school of drones be “piloted”, formed, moved and dissolved to carry out individual
or collective tasks? How can we generate “collective intelligence” to optimize its
movement to a given location? How can communication between units be
optimized, and what is the optimal shape of the school of drones to harness
hydrodynamic “forces”? What happens if the flow becomes turbulent? The project aims to formalize and find answers to these questions, using the tools of statistical
physics, non-linear physics and control theory.

### Additional activities
- The development of the project will require the recruited person to invest in doctoral and post-doctoral
supervision and supervision of Master's courses in mathematics and applications.
- It is also recommended that, during the course of this Chair, applications for project funding will be
submitted (ANR, Région, etc.).
- The person recruited is expected to play an active role in the UFR's internationalisation strategy for its
training courses.
- The person recruited will also be involved in scientific dissemination, at several levels, both to the general
public and to specialists.
- As the theme of this Chair is one of the university's strategic priorities, the person recruited will be required
to take account of the local context: activities of the university's other laboratories in the maritime field,
meetings with local socio-economic players and, where appropriate, integration into the University of
Toulon's institutes that have been set up or are in the process of being set up and whose activities will be
related to the theme of this Chair.

### Other info
-  The chair will run for four years.
- It benefits from specific funding (in addition to the laboratory's recurrent resources): 2 years of postdoc, 1
thesis (3 years), and €40k of operating costs for the duration of the chair.
- The volume of annual teaching hours envisaged during the contract is as follows:
   - 1st year: 64 hours of supervised work equivalent (HeTD)
   - 2nd year: 64 HeTD
   - 3rd year: 96 HeTD
   - 4th year: 128 HeTD

### Skills required
- Willingness to get involved in teaching teams and to monitor students to help them prepare for their
professional future.
- Ability to lead collective projects at the level of the laboratory, the Science and Technology Department
and/or the institution, and in particular to develop international partnerships at both teaching and research
level and in setting up and managing contracts.
- Teaching experience in the required speciality (mathematics)
- As part of the school's strategy, international experience and the ability to teach in English would be highly
appreciated.
- Ability to communicate and work with theoretical physicists, willingness to collaborate with applied
scientists and the private industrial sector
- Ability and willingness to work on multidisciplinary projects
