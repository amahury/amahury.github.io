### Introduction
Dear Colleagues,

This Special Issue focuses on theoretical and experimental approaches to understanding information processing in complex biological and artificial systems, with particular emphasis on entropy-based analysis and optimization. We welcome contributions that advance our understanding of how biological and artificial systems encode, process, and transmit information, particularly emphasizing the following:
1. Information theory applications in biological and artificial neural systems;
2. Knowledge distillation and model compression techniques in neural networks;
3. Entropy-based approaches to understanding system complexity and efficiency;
4. Information processing optimization in resource-constrained environments;
5. Bio-inspired approaches to efficient information processing;
6. Computational modeling of information flow in complex systems;
7. Low-rank and sparse representations in biological and artificial systems;
8. Multi-scale information integration and processing;
9. Energy-efficient information processing in biological and artificial systems;
10. Quantitative measures of information compression and preservation.

We welcome both original research articles and comprehensive reviews covering these topics. Of particular interest are studies that:
- Investigate information-theoretic approaches to system optimization;
- Explore novel methods for efficient information processing;
- Examine parallels between biological and artificial information processing systems;
- Address resource constraints in information processing systems.

Prof. Dr. Young-Seok Choi

### Submission Guidelines
Manuscripts should be submitted online at www.mdpi.com by registering and logging in to this website. Once you are registered, click here to go to the submission form. Manuscripts can be submitted until the deadline. All submissions that pass pre-check are peer-reviewed. Accepted papers will be published continuously in the journal (as soon as accepted) and will be listed together on the special issue website. Research articles, review articles as well as short communications are invited. For planned papers, a title and short abstract (about 100 words) can be sent to the Editorial Office for announcement on this website.

Submitted manuscripts should not have been published previously, nor be under consideration for publication elsewhere (except conference proceedings papers). All manuscripts are thoroughly refereed through a single-blind peer-review process. A guide for authors and other relevant information for submission of manuscripts is available on the Instructions for Authors page. Entropy is an international peer-reviewed open access monthly journal published by MDPI.

Please visit the Instructions for Authors page before submitting a manuscript. The Article Processing Charge (APC) for publication in this open access journal is 2600 CHF (Swiss Francs). Submitted papers should be well formatted and use good English. Authors may use MDPI's English editing service prior to publication or during author revisions.
