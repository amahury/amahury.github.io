We are accepting applications for the 2025 cohort until October 11, 2024.

The Santa Fe Institute **Complexity Postdoctoral Fellowships**, comprising the Omidyar Fellowships, are unique among postdoctoral appointments. The Fellowships offer early-career scholars the opportunity to undertake their own independent research within a collaborative research community that nurtures creative, transdisciplinary thought in pursuit of key insights about the complex systems that matter most for science and society. The Institute rejects compartmentalized thought common in academia. Instead, SFI scientists transcend boundaries between fields, freely synthesizing ideas spanning many disciplines – from math, physics, computer science and biology to the social sciences and the humanities – in pursuit of creative insights that advance our scientific frontiers.

Postdoctoral Fellows spend up to three years in residence at SFI, where they contribute to SFI’s research in the sciences of complexity and are trained to become leaders in interdisciplinary science.  As thought leaders who shape the future of science, Postdoctoral Fellows also participate in a unique training program structured to develop leadership skills throughout their three-year residencies and beyond. The Institute provides an opportunity to collaborate with leading researchers worldwide, discretionary and collaborative funds, and a competitive salary with a generous benefit package including paid family leave.

The Institute has no formal programs or departments. Research is collaborative and spans the physical, natural, and social sciences. Most research is theoretical (SFI does not have lab facilities) and/or computational in nature, although it may include an empirical component. SFI has 21 postdoctoral researchers, 10 resident faculty, 100+ external faculty, and averages 1000 visitors per year. Descriptions of the research themes and interests of the faculty and current Fellows can be found at SFI Research.

### You will be asked to provide the following application materials:

1. Curriculum vitae (including publication list).

2. Statement of research interests (max. 2 pages) including a summary of the research you would like to pursue and why, and what your broader interests are.

3. Description of interest in SFI (max. 1 page) that describes your potential contribution to the SFI community and also explains the potential impact of SFI on your research. Consider addressing one or more of the following: What kind of input from other fields would most improve your future research? What type of multidisciplinary workshop might you want to organize during your Fellowship? What aspects of your present or future research are difficult to pursue in a traditional academic environment? What experiences, if any, do you have related to SFI's goal of fostering a diverse and inclusive scientific community?

4. Three letters of recommendation from scholars who know your work. 

(SFI will contact your recommenders directly with instructions for submitting letters. These letters will be sent independently of the application direct to SFI. When you start completing the online application, please complete this segment early so that recommenders have time to send the letter. Be prepared to provide names and e-mail addresses for the three individuals who will recommend you.)
