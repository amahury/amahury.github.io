### About
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is an emerging field aiming at the building of “thinking machines”; that is, general-purpose systems with intelligence comparable to that of the human mind (and perhaps ultimately well beyond human general intelligence).

While this was the original goal of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the mainstream of AI research has turned toward domain-dependent and problem-specific solutions; therefore it has become necessary to use a new name to indicate research that still pursues the “Grand AI Dream”. Similar labels for this kind of research include “Strong AI”, “Human-level AI”, etc. AGI research differs from ordinary AI research by stressing the versatility and wholeness of intelligence, and by carrying out the engineering practice according to an outline of a system comparable to the human mind in a certain sense.

The problems involved in creating general-purpose intelligent systems are very different from those involved in creating special-purpose systems. Therefore, this society is different from conventional AI research societies in its stress on the long-term potential of research towards the ultimate goal of AGI, rather than immediate applications.

### Relevant Topics

There is a growing recognition, in the AI field and beyond that the threshold of achieving AGI — where machine intelligence matches or even surpasses human intelligence — is within our near-term reach.

This increases the importance of building our fundamental understanding of what AGI is and can be, and what are the various routes for getting there. Some relevant questions are:
- What kinds of AGI systems may be feasible to create in the near term, with what relative strengths and weaknesses?
- What are the biggest unsolved problems we need to resolve to get to human-level AGI?
- What are the right ways to measure the capabilities of AI systems as they approach and then exceed human-level AGI?
- What are the most feasible methodologies to provide emerging AGI systems with guidance, both cognitively and ethically, as they develop?
- How should we think about the roles of industry, government, academia and the open source community in the next stages of development toward AGI?
- How will the advent of AGI alter the fabric of society, our jobs, and our daily lives?

### Submit A Contribution
The AGI Society and AGI Technical Conference team invites you, the AI researcher, academic, and industry professional to submit your original research papers to our 2025 conference.

The AGI conference series is the only major conference series devoted wholly and specifically to the creation of AI systems possessing general intelligence at the human level and ultimately beyond.

By gathering together active researchers in the field, for presentation of results and discussion of ideas, we accelerate our progress toward our common goal.

We welcome contributed papers on all aspects of AGI research and development. The conference will embrace different interpretations of “AGI”, and welcome submissions that do not only address specific problems.

Requirements for submission include:
- Papers must be written in either LaTeX (preferred) or Word
- Author guidelines and templates can be downloaded here.
- Submissions will be double-blind: reviewers cannot see author names when conducting reviews, and authors cannot see reviewer names. All submissions must be anonymized and may not contain any information with the intention or consequence of violating the double-blind reviewing process.

Authors can revise their paper as many times as needed up to the paper submission deadline. Changes to the paper will not be allowed while the paper is being reviewed.

Two Types of Papers will be accepted (in Easychair):
1. Regular papers, with a length limit of 10 pages (including references), presenting new research results or rigorously describing new research ideas.
2. Short technical communications, with a limit of 4 pages (including references), summarizing results and ideas of interest to the AGI audience, including reports about recent publications, position papers, and preliminary results.

AGI-25 will include one day of workshops, tutorials and software/hardware demos. These sessions are expected to fill either a half or full day of presentations, thematically linked, and will be both live-hosted and live-streamed.

To submit proposals for a Workshops or Tutorials session include the following information in an email to agiconference@singularitynet.io

Workshops, tutorials, and demos are open to everyone who has registered for AGI 25. To be considered for the workshop, tutorial, or demo, please send a proposal via email. Be sure the proposal meets the requirements and includes all the listed items.
