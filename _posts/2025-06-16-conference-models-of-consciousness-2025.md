### Introduction
By the kind invitation of Hokkaido University’s Center for Human Nature, Artificial Intelligence, and Neuroscience, we, the Association for Mathematical Consciousness Science, and all of our organising and supporting institutions, are delighted to announce the sixth Models of Consciousness conference (MoC6) 2025. As the first occasion of the conference to be held in Asia, Hokkaido University in the city of Sapporo, Japan, provides an exciting location for the conference and a wonderful opportunity to make new research connections.

The conference is devoted to bringing together researchers whose scientific activities relate to models of consciousness and mathematical approaches in the scientific study of consciousness. This year’s edition of the conference comprises the following core themes:
- Philosophy of Consciousness and Mathematized Phenomenology
- Quantum Approaches to Consciousness and their Assumptions
- Research on Artificial Consciousness

The MoC conference series began at the University of Oxford in 2019, went online in 2021, and was then held at Stanford University in 2022, Oxford University in 2023 and the University of Bamberg in 2024. We are delighted that MoC6 is being hosted at Hokkaido University in Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan from September 30 to October 4, 2025.

The conference comprises a diverse programme of activities designed to maximise opportunities to advance the scientific goals of the field, including invited talks and contributed talks by application, discussion sessions on open questions, and a colourful social programme. Participation is by registration only; the link is at the bottom of this page.

We look forward to welcoming you to Hokkaido University, Japan!

### Apply to give a talk!
The conference hosts various opportunities for participants to present their research to the community. (Participants are also welcome to attend without giving a talk.)
- Participant talks: Participants are invited to apply to present their research in a 25-minute talk slot (20 minutes for the talk plus 5 minutes for questions).
- Showcase talks: A small number of talk applications may be selected by the organising committee to be “showcase talks” that attract the offer of a 30 or 40-minute non-parallel talk slot.
- Lightning talks: Participants are invited to apply to present a 5-minute lightning talk.

For details regarding the application to give a talk, please see our talk application page. The deadline for all application submissions is 6 July 2025.

Following the spirit and tradition of previous MoC conferences, discussion sessions in small groups are an integral part of the conference. These give participants a chance to discuss open questions in the field and are intended to help develop a shared sense of purpose and long-term goals among researchers who work on mathematical approaches in the scientific study of consciousness.

Each discussion session will focus on a specific question, related to models of consciousness, the development of Mathematical Consciousness Science, characterization and classification of research projects, and similar topics that focus on bringing greater clarity and transparency to the field. Participants will also be able to suggest and vote on topics using the conference’s web interface during the conference.

### Core Themes
We are delighted to announce that Models of Consciousness 6 comprises the following core themes. (However, please note that contributed talk applications are open to any topic in the field.)

1. Philosophy of Consciousness and Mathematized Phenomenology: Under this theme we explore the philosophical posits behind models of consciousness and the use of mathematics in bringing phenomenology within reach of our scientific understanding.
2. Quantum Approaches to Consciousness and their Assumptions: Several connections between quantum processes and consciousness have been proposed. Under this theme we consider whether quantum approaches convey advantages over classical models of consciousness, and explore assumptions that imply the relevance of quantum theory.
3. Research on Artificial Consciousness: The question of whether contemporary or near-term Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be conscious or not is of great and pressing importance. As mathematical consciousness scientists and AI researchers increase their efforts, we invite contributions on the latest research and insights into artificial consciousness.

### How to join the conference?
We invite researchers of all disciplines who have an interest in the scientific study of consciousness to join MoC6.
