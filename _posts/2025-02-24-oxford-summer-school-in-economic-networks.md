We are excited to host world leading academics, scientists, and global policy makers to guide lectures, engage with students and host workshops on topics relating to network theory and economics. These will include topics of social networks, games and learning, financial networks, economic complexity, urban systems and innovation. 

The keynote for 2025 will be Aaron Clauset (University of Colorado Boulder). Our amazing line-up of confirmed speakers include Elisa Omodei (Central European University), Christian Diem (University of Oxford), Marta Gonzalez (UC Berkeley), Doyne Farmer (University of Oxford), Zoltán Elekes (HUN-REN KRTK), Renaud Lambiotte (University of Oxford),  Hyejin Youn (Seoul National University),  Rama Cont (University of Oxford), Elsa Arcaute (University College London) and Fabian Braesemann (University of Oxford). 

The Oxford Summer School in Economic Networks is hosted by the Mathematical Institute and the Institute for New Economic Thinking at the Oxford Martin School. 

The school is in person only. No lectures will be streamed. Lectures and tutorials will be held in the Department of Statistics (24-29 St Giles', Oxford OX1 3LB) and Lady Margaret Hall College (Norham Gardens, Oxford OX2 6QA).

### Dates 
- 3rd March: Application portal closes
- 17th March: Admission notifications
- Fee due 14 days after receipt of payment link.
- 23rd - 27th June: Summer school in session

### Eligibility
The school is targeted towards postgraduate students (Masters/PhD) from Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Social Sciences, Geography, Development and Public Policy; students from other disciplines and interested early career professionals are also invited to apply. 

We occasionally admit outstanding undergraduate students with strong quantitative experience in economic networks. 

You will need some quantitative/computational background including familiarity with university level linear algebra and dynamical systems, and some coding experience. 

Some existing experience with network analysis is typical. 

### Application
In order to apply, you will need to submit a 1 page CV and a short motivation letter to attend the summer school. 

The application form can be found here. The deadline for submission is March 3rd 2025. 

Note 1: If you would like to be considered for early admission due to visa timelines (only for those needing a visa) we will consider these from Jan 15, 2025. Please fill in the form and contact n.oclery at ucl.ac.uk directly. 

Note 2: Accommodation in Oxford is tricky and can be expensive. We suggest to book cancellable/refundable accommodation when you apply for the school. 

### Fee
The fee for the school, which includes tuition and social events only, is £400. The fee will be payable within 2 weeks of acceptance (specifically, receipt of payment link). The fee is unfortunately strictly non-refundable as we have fixed costs to pay. We are non-profit and all of your fees go directly into the school costs. 

Social events typically include a welcome drinks reception, a semi-formal dinner, a walking tour of Oxford and punting (rowing) on the river in small groups. Travel and accommodation is not included in the fee, and is organised by students themselves. Meals (except for the dinner) are also not included, but there are plentiful affordable options in the vicinity of the school.  

Note: Accommodation in Oxford is tricky and can be expensive. We suggest to book cancellable/refundable accommodation when you apply for the school. 

### Contact 
The organising team includes Neave O'Clery (Chair, UCL, MI, OMS), Xiaowen Dong (Co-Chair, Oxford-Man, EngSci), Laura Mazzarino (UCL), Jishan Duan (UCL), Gavin Rolls (Northeastern University London) and Justin Wang Ngai Yeung (Northeastern University London).
