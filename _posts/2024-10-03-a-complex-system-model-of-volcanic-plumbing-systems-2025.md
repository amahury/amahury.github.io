**Supervision**: Catherine Annen (volcanologist, Institute of Geophysics of the Czech Academy of Sciences) and RÃ©my Cazabet (Computer Scientist, LIRIS Laboratory and IXXI, University Lyon 1, France)

We propose an interdisciplinary, international Ph.D. position between France and the Czech Republic.

The objective of this Ph.D. is to develop a new kind of model to study volcanic plumbing systems, using a complex system approach. The Ph.D. student will work at the boundaries between geophysics/volcanology and computer science/complex systems.

We are looking for an open-minded student, with a background in one of the fields of interest of the thesis, and a strong interest in the other. The thesis can start as soon as we found a suitable candidate.
