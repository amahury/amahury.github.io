### Call for Abstracts

We are thrilled to announce the 15th edition of  the  HIW Graduate Student Conference. This year, the conference will take place on April 24th, 2026, and will feature presentations by our graduate students. Additionally, we are excited to announce that we will be hosting Sibo Kanobana as our keynote speaker!

We thus invite students from the M.A., Research Master, and Ph.D. programs at HIW to submit abstracts. We are also open to submissions from those who are unaffiliated with KU Leuven, although these acceptances will be limited and any travel expenses will not be covered. We welcome abstracts on all topics related to philosophy as we want to represent the diversity of the research being conducted at the institute. The Graduate Student Conference is an excellent opportunity for HIW students to present their work, whether it be a thesis chapter, research paper, or submission to The Apricot Graduate Journal, and familiarize themselves with the format of conferences. Each presentation should be 15-20 minutes long, followed by a discussion of 10-15 minutes.

If you have any piece you would like to share with students and professors at the Institute of Philosophy, please submit your abstract to gsc.hiw@kuleuven.be. The abstract should not exceed 200 words in length. Please omit any identifying information from your abstract and send a separate file with the author’s identifying information (your name, surname, program) to guarantee a blind review. The deadline for submission of abstracts is the 6th of March.

We look forward to reading your abstracts and are eager to hear about your research at the Graduate Student Conference!

For more information, please contact our Committee at gsc.hiw@kuleuven.be.
