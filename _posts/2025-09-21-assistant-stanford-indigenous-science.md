### About 
We seek applicants for a tenure-track appointment at the assistant professor level in the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability in the field of Traditional Ecological Knowledge (also referred to as Indigenous and local knowledge, Indigenous science, Native science, and other similar terms) and its relevance to social and environmental sustainability. Topical research areas of interest include, but are not limited to: the role of fire and other aspects of Indigenous land stewardship in the changing climate; establishment and management of natural protected areas; conservation and application of the wild relatives of crops and animals; the ethical and responsible collection and use of socio-ecological data; environmental governance; the role of tribal food and land sovereignty and cultural revitalization for environmental sustainability; and two-eyed seeing, the multicultural approach to understanding the natural world using both Indigenous and Western sciences as independent, but complementary, ways of knowing.

The range of expertise and facilities across Stanford University’s main campus, as well as Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve ('Ootchamin 'Ooyakma) and Hopkins Marine Station, provide opportunities to develop a research program that bridges Indigenous and Western knowledge systems.
