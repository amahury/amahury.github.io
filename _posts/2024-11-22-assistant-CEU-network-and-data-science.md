### General
The Department of Network and Data Science invites applications for a full-time faculty position at the assistant professor level in the area of social data science. We expect applications from candidates with a background in computer science, social data science or computational social science with an outstanding academic record.

The ideal candidate will have a strong motivation to conduct interdisciplinary research and a keen interest in collaborating on projects across multiple departments at CEU. We particularly encourage applications from individuals whose research would enhance the intellectual diversity of the department.

The Department of Network and Data Science is an interdisciplinary unit, integrating natural, computational, and social science approaches. Further information about the Department of Network and Data Science is available at: http://networkdatascience.ceu.edu.

- Teaching undergraduate and graduate courses in data science, including programming, advanced machine learning methods, and artificial intelligence topics applied to social contexts.
- Producing high-quality academic research in the field of Social Data Science.
- Supervising theses at both undergraduate and graduate levels.

The standard teaching load at CEU is comparable to that of research universities, 12 US credits per academic year, in addition to thesis supervision.

### Qualifications 
We seek applications from candidates with a background in Computer Science, Social Data Science, or Computational Social Science, who have an outstanding academic record.

Candidates must hold a PhD in one of these or closely related fields. They should demonstrate:
- An excellent record of publications in international peer-reviewed journals.

- Strong recommendations attesting to their academic, teaching and professional capabilities.

We offer an annual gross salary of €70,000.

The initial contract will be for a six-year term, with the possibility of promotion to Associate Professor with an indefinite-term contract.

### How to Apply
Applicants are required to submit the following documents:
- A comprehensive curriculum vitae (C.V.).
- A list of publications.
- A sample publication.
- A short statement of research and teaching.
- The names and contact details of three referees (candidates should arrange for two of the referees to send their recommendations directly to CEU).

The review of applications will begin on January 15, 2025, and will continue until the position is filled.

CEU is an equal opportunity employer and values geographical and gender diversity, thus encouraging applications from women and/or other underrepresented groups. Since CEU strives to increase the share of women in professorial positions, given equal qualifications, preference will be given to female applicants. CEU recognizes that personal and family circumstances shape the trajectory of one’s career and working patterns. As such, and in line with CEU’s promotion of Equal Opportunities, we encourage applicants to detail periods of leave, part-time work or other such situations in their applications so that the Search Committee is able to assess an applicant’s academic record fairly in the context of their circumstances. Any declaration of personal and family circumstances is voluntary and will be handled confidentially and only considered in so far as it impacts on the academic career of an applicant.
