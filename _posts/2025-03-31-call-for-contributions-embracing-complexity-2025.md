### About
This workshop will offer a comprehensive and interdisciplinary perspective on the applications of emergence in examining various real-world systems, including its use in understanding high-order interactions and complexity across diverse biological and ecological scales. With an emphasis on the micro-to-macro relations between cells, humans, and ecology, we aim to present emergence both as a practical tool and a principled approach.

The mornings will be devoted to theory-driven presentations that draw from recent operational advances in capturing emergent phenomena, while the afternoons will feature hands-on sessions tailored for practical implementation of these topics. Something we are most thrilled about will be a coordinated outdoor excursion during the week to unwind and visit the island. This is not all, we also plan to have an immersive installation centred on exploring a collective experience of emergence with the voluntary participation of all the attendees. We hope you will also be pleased to join! 

### Registration
All applications should submit an abstract, which will be the key element for selection. There are 35 available spots for external participants, and a waiting list will be established. The selection will be based on the evaluation of the poster/abstract proposal. After selection, participants will be asked to pay a fee of 400â‚¬, which will cover 5 nights (from the 22nd to the 26th of June) at the residency of the Universidad de las Islas Baleares, breakfast, lunch, coffee breaks and the excursion. 

### Submission Deadline 
7th of April of 2025. The selection will be announced in mid-April 2025.
