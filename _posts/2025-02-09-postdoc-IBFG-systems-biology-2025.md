### About the Program
IBFG is a research institute located in Salamanca (Spain), which is jointly managed by the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) and the University of Salamanca. The Institute fosters research groups covering a broad range of interests, from molecular biology to quantitative systems biology and biotechnology. Laboratories at IBFG are funded by regional, national, and international agencies, including the European Research Council (ERC).

The new Systems Biology Unit at IBFG is launching a postdoctoral program that will provide state-of-the-art training in Systems Biology research, as well as training opportunities in academic skills (writing, communication, outreach, etc.). Postdocs in the program will also receive mentoring and support to navigate the national and international academic job markets, and will be integrated into the Spanish academic system and connected with our international network of collaborators and partners.

### Benefits
Successful candidates will integrate in a highly interdisciplinary and collaborative environment and will benefit from:
- A work contract of up to 4 years with a competitive salary (38,000 - 42,000€/year).
- Integration into the Spanish Social Security System, including full health and occupational insurance coverage.
- Access to state-of-the-art laboratories.
- Support for attending international workshops and conferences.
- Opportunities to mentor students at the undergraduate and graduate levels.

### Elegibility
Candidates must be eligible for work in the European Union and hold a PhD in Biology, Biochemistry, Bioinformatics, Physics, Mathematics or related fields — degrees in different areas will also be considered provided that the candidate is able to justify their relevance to the advertised positions. Candidates must show a strong track record and an ability to work collaboratively with other members of the laboratory as well as with other groups at the Institute. Candidates are expected to be open to applying for postdoctoral fellowships or external funding with the full support of the group and the IBFG.

Positions are available for the research areas detailed below. More information about each area is available on the linked websites. A same candidate may apply for one or various areas, provided that they fulfill the indicated requirements.

### Application 
Applications will be reviewed on a running basis. After an initial screening, pre-selected candidates will be invited to give a short presentation (virtually), after which there will be a brief Q&A session with the IBFG principal investigators. The tentative date for this first round of virtual interviews is March 2025. A reduced number of candidates may also be invited for in-person visits to the IBFG. Selected candidates will start their appointments around Fall 2025.

You will be asked to upload an updated CV, the names and emails of two references, and a one-page motivation letter where you briefly describe your scientific background and interests, and why you think you are a good fit for this call. Further questions can be referred to inter_ibfg@usal.es.
