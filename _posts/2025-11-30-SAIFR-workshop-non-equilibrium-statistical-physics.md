Despite decades of theoretical effort marked by numberless outstanding contributions, the study of non-equilibrium phenomena is still at the forefront of Statistical Physics research. For the past few years, we have witnessed exciting new developments not only in traditionally difficult problems such as glasses and complex systems, but also in rapidly evolving fields as active matter and stochastic thermodynamics.

Our Workshop on Non-equilibrium Statistical Physics will bring together experienced students and researchers to discuss a wide variety of these disparate systems. On the one hand, our goal is to attract a vast and well established community of Brazilian and South American researchers working in complex systems (broadly defined). At the same time, we find it important to expose this community to a broad range of opportunities in sub-fields that have attracted much attention due to fascinating new phenomena with applications in soft matter, biology and social sciences. In addition to several research seminars that will be given by outstanding invited speakers, selected participants will have the opportunity to present short talks and posters.

Registration deadline: December 10, 2025
