The Fundación General CSIC (FGCSIC) launches the fourth edition of its ComFuturo programme: ComFuturo iAGE, a postdoctoral initiative co-financed by the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions COFUND scheme of the European Union. This edition is dedicated to tackling the pressing global challenge of ageing through cutting-edge research and, where relevant, the transformative potential of digitalisation.

ComFuturo iAGE offers 10 fellowships to outstanding experienced researchers from anywhere in the world. Fellows will independently propose and develop innovative research projects aligned with one of the eligible topics related to ageing (most of which also involve digitalisation) at one of the more than 120 research institutes of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), Spain’s largest public research organisation.

The ComFuturo fellowship will include a three-year employment contract for the beneficiary researchers, with a salary and financial complements to cover moving expenses, housing or family obligations; and an annual allowance for expenses associated with the development of their research.

Researchers of any nationality who have obtained a doctoral degree within the last 8 years and who have not resided or carried out their main activity (work or studies) in Spain for more than 12 months in the last three years may apply for this call (there are exceptions to these rules, duly explained in the Call guidelines). Research projects must have a maximum duration of three years and be carried out in one of the more than 120 CSIC institutes distributed throughout the Spanish territory (for some eligible topics, a specific predefined host CSIC institute is established). Each candidate must demonstrate in their application that the CSIC institute that would host the development of their research activity is suitable and that they are willing to host them in the event that they are finally awarded with a ComFuturo fellowship.

Queries regarding the application process will be attended via the following email address: comfuturo@fgcsic.es

The deadline for applications is 9 January 2026 at 10:00 a.m. CET.
