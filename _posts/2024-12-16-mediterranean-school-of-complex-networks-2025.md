In the last decade, network theory has been revealed to be a perfect instrument to model the structure of complex systems and the dynamical process they are involved into. The wide variety of applications to social sciences, technological networks, biology, transportation and economic, to cite just only some of them, showed that network theory is suitable to provide new insights into many problems. Given the success of the Ninth Edition in 2024 of the Mediterranean School of Complex Networks, we call for applications to the Tenth Edition in 2025.

The official language of the School is ENGLISH.

The School will award two prizes: to one attendant, for the best flash talk and to one lecturer, for the best lecture.

- Application deadline (no payment needed at this stage): 11 February 2025
- Notification of Acceptance: 18 February 2025
- Registration deadline (payment needed): 3 March 2025
- School: 30 June - 5 July 2025

### Our mission
- Provide a theoretical background to students (Master, PhD) and young researchers in the field, with particular attention to current trends in Network Science.
- Promote philosophical and scientific exchange between all participants, i.e., lecturers and attendants.

### Why choose us
The program will involve lectures from experts in different fields for 70% of the duration of the school. The remaining time will be dedicated to:
- Flash talks given by attendants, followed by debates;
- Thematic round tables involving lecturers and attendants.

Renowned for its rich history, art, and architecture, the island seamlessly blends ancient Greek ruins with Baroque masterpieces. Its thriving cultural scene, from museums to local traditions, makes it an ideal setting for intellectual pursuits.

As participants of the Mediterranean School of Complex Networks, you’ll experience an inspiring environment that has long been a crossroads of civilizations and ideas, perfect for fostering creativity and collaboration.

### Application 
Undergraduate/graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in any discipline are invited to apply. 

Minimum background requirements include knowledge of:
- Fundaments of Mathematics (calculus and linear algebra).
- Fundaments of Probability and Statistics.
- Fundaments of Networks Science.
- Fluent use of english.

**Number of available in-person positions is limited to 50.**

After your application to the school, our Scientific Committee will review each submission and identify the most qualified candidates. You will receive a notification once the selection process is complete.

Submission through the GoogleForm system consists of a single PDF file including: an updated CV (2 pages) and a Cover Letter (1 page). Please, be sure to specify your current affiliation / host institution, your research interests and why you would like to attend the school.

Our Scientific Committee will evaluate each application and rank the applicants. After this first phase, you will receive a notification of acceptance or rejection.

If your application has been accepted, you will receive new instructions to finalize your registration to the MSCx and proceed with the payment.

Warning: Applications received after the official deadline might be subjected to additional processing charges (50€).
