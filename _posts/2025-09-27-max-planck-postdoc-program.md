### About
The Max Planck Postdoc Program provides talented early career researchers with a range of attractive opportunities to advance their careers in science. Applications are accepted twice a year - on March 1 and September 1. The Max Planck Society offers bundled postdoc positions to interested top talents. The second call for applications starts on September 1, 2025, and ends on October 13, 2025.

The new Max Planck Postdoc Program offers early career researchers the following benefits:
- A guaranteed contract duration of at least three years,
- Targeted mentoring program, including mentors from other research institutes or industry,
- Career workshop within two years, allowing postdocs to explore their potential for a career in science, industry or entrepreneurship at an early stage,
- Access to the career development and coaching offer of the Planck Academy,
- Guidelines for mentoring and supervision to ensure high standards of supervision.

With the first call for applications in April 2025, a new recruitment procedure was introduced. Positions are advertised collectively twice a year â€“ on March 1 and September 1. Each call for applications will remain open for six weeks. This structured approach aligns with international standards and better matches the timelines when potential candidates complete their degrees and seek their next career step.

### Application Procedure
The online portal provides access to job opportunities for postdoctoral researchers. Positions can be filtered by location and subject area. Candidates may apply for multiple positions if they wish.

Interested researchers need to upload their application documents in English only once. The application must include:
- A cover letter
- A CV with a list of publications
- A summary of previous research experience
- A statement explaining interest in the position

Additionally, depending on the requirements of the respective postdoctoral position, applicants must provide the e-mail addresses of 2-3 references who can provide a letter of recommendation.

 After the application deadline, the respective principal auditors review all submissions. Applicants will be informed via the system if they have proceeded to the next stage. Successful candidates will receive an offer for a postdoctoral position. Those who applied for multiple positions and were successful may receive offers from several institutes.

The Max Planck Society will complement the program with existing support services, for example in the areas of family and dual career, Industry Track, spin-offs as well as information for international applicants.
