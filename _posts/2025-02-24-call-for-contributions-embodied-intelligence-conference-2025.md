### General Info
The conference is structured with a morning session and afternoon session each day to accommodate different time zones. Each session includes plenary talks, panel discussions (including flash talks by leading researchers), and breakout sessions as shown in the tentative programme. While plenary and panel speakers are invitation-only, we solicit wider contributions in breakout sessions to facilitate more focused and technical discussions. In addition to traditional conference talks for all prominent and young academics, this year we will be running masterclasses when all participants can come and talk to leading researcher in all fields of Robotic exploration.

### Topics
We want to use this conference to answer some of the key open questions relating to EI, this includes, but is not limited to:
- What is (embodied) intelligence?
- How does computation come about from embodiment?
- How does language emerge?
- How do we understand intelligence and what theories do we have to represent it?
- What are the common curriencies?
- How can we measure complexity?
- What can not be done by computation intelligence?
- What ethical questions arise from EI?

### Dates
Deadline to submit your contribution is March 7. The conference will be held during April 4-6 online.
