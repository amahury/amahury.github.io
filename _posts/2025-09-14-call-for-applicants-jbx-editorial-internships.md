We are excited to announce that we are inviting applications for the fourth round of JXB Editorial Internships. The aim of these internships is to provide early career researchers with experience of scientific publishing from the editorial side, as an opportunity for career development as a researcher, or with a view to a career in scientific publishing. The successful applicants will be involved in quality control and scientific assessment of 6-12 submitted manuscripts under the mentorship of JXB’s Editors and will be fully supported by the JXB editorial office. They will receive guidance on how to review a manuscript and also help communicate the journal’s most exciting content and new developments in the field of plant science by writing 1-2 Insight articles to be published in the journal, and other content for the JXB website and social media accounts.

These part-time internships will run for one year, starting on January 1st 2026, and the journal will offer a small honorarium and free SEB membership for one year to each Editorial Intern. All editorial work associated with the internships will be conducted online.

The deadline for applications is 30th September 2025, and the call is restricted to researchers with 2–8 years postgraduate/postdoctoral experience, excluding periods of leave. If you would like to apply to become a JXB Editorial Intern, please submit the following documents via e-mail to JXB’s Managing Editor at m.page@sebiology.org:
- An up-to-date copy of your CV (max. 2 pages) including the names of two referees.
- A cover letter (max. 500 words) to briefly explain your motivation for applying, and to convey anything not highlighted in your CV.
- A commentary in the style of JXB’s Insight articles (max. 1500 words), on a JXB research paper published on or after 1st July 2024.
