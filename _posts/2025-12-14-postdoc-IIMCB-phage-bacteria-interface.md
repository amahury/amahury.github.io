### About the project
Antibiotic resistance in pathogens such as Acinetobacter baumannii is a critical global health challenge. Bacteriophages - the natural predators of bacteria - offer promising solutions, but whole-phage therapy carries risks of spreading resistance genes. Our project takes a different approach: mining phage genomes for molecular effectors that disrupt bacterial physiology.

We hypothesize that phages encode novel RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that hijack host RNA metabolism. Using time-resolved transcriptomics, interactome mapping, and single-molecule biophysics, we will dissect the molecular arms race between phages and A. baumannii. This integrated strategy combines RNA-Seq, CRAC, RIL-Seq, and smTIRF microscopy to reveal new mechanisms of RNA regulation and identify targets for next-generation antimicrobials.

### Key responsabilities
1. Design and execute experiments in molecular biology, biochemistry, and single-molecule imaging.
2. Perform RNA-Seq and bioinformatic analysis of phage-infected bacterial transcriptomes.
3. Map RNA-protein and RNA-RNA interaction networks using CRAC, RIL-Seq, and co-IP/MS.
4. Reconstitute key interactions in vitro and analyze them using smTIRF microscopy.
5. Collaborate with international partners and mentor junior researchers.
6. Present results at international conferences and contribute to high-impact publications.
7. Initiate and drive new subprojects

### Candidate profile 
We are looking for a researcher who:

1. Holds (or is about to obtain) a PhD in molecular biology, biochemistry, or biophysics.
2. Fulfills the formal criteria outlined in paragraph 2, point 2.1.1 of the NCN regulations https://www.ncn.gov.pl/sites/default/files/pliki/uchwaly-rady/2024/uchwala84_2024-zal1_ang.pdf
3. Has strong expertise in RNA biology, protein biochemistry, or phage biology; experience with single-molecule techniques is a plus.
4. Is curious about RNA regulation and antimicrobial strategies.
5. Has a solid publication record and can work independently.
6. Communicates fluently in English (written and oral)
7. Is enthusiastic about working in an interdisciplinary, international, and collaborative environment

### Selection criteria
Applications will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

1. Education and formal qualifications.
2. Technical expertise and relevance of experience to the project.
3. Scientific achievements (e.g., publications, awards, grants, international collaborations).
4. Proficiency in English (written and spoken).

### Our offer
1. Full-time employment for 6 months with the possibility of extension for the whole duration of the project (4 year in total).
2. Competitive salary of approximately 9700 PLN gross/month.
3. 13th salary after working for at least 6 calendar months in a given year, private medical care, and Multisport benefit.
4. 100% research focus - no teaching duties.
5. Support from a lab manager and technical assistant.
6. Access to cutting-edge equipment (custom-built TIRF microscope, core facilities).
7. Strong mentorship toward independent funding applications (e.g., NCN, EMBO, MSCA).
8. Opportunities for international training, courses, and conferences.

Deadline: January 5, 2026
