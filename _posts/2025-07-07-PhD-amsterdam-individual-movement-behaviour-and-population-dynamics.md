description: Are you in interested in exploring the connection between movement behavior and ecological dynamics? Do you enjoy combining mathematical models and data to understand how ecological systems work? The Department of Theoretical and Computation Ecology is looking for an ambitious PhD student to work at the intersection of movement ecology and community ecology.

### About the position
This position is part of a 2-PhD student project funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation to link movement ecology and functional response theory. The dynamics of ecological communities arise from vast numbers of individual interactions, such as the consumption of prey by a predator. A critical factor determining the dynamics of interacting populations is how the strength of interactions among populations (number of interactions per unit time) varies as a function of the densities of both predator and prey populations. The shape of this relationship, known as the functional response (FR), has profound implications for the coexistence, collapse, or cyclical dynamics of two or more interacting populations. In this project, you will collaborate closely with an international team of experimental and theoretical ecologists from the University of Amsterdam, University of Zurich, and Cornell University. Your research will specifically explore how different functional response types arise from individual movement behaviours, with the goal of developing a mechanistic understanding of the links between individual-level behaviours and broader food web dynamics. You will work within an experimental system using protist communities, enabling high-resolution measurements of both behavioural and population-level data. 

### Tasks and responsibilities
- Develop mathematical models to scale up direct observations of individual movement behaviour to understand mechanisms that can lead to different functional response shapes in single-prey contexts.
- Fit and compare models using high-resolution movement data from an experimental protist system.
- Write up findings for peer reviewed international publications.
- Present findings at internal meeting and national and international scientific conferences.
- Assist with teaching courses in quantitative biology (10% of your time).
- Develop skills to become an independent scientist. 

### Your profile
- Strong interest in fundamental research in ecology;
- Experience and interest in mathematical modelling;
- Some previous experience in data analysis;
- Familiarity with scientific programming in (e.g. R, Python, or Matlab);
- Strong communication abilities both orally and in writing.

### Our offer
A temporary contract for 38 hours per week for the duration of 4 years (the initial contract will be for a period of 18 months and after satisfactory evaluation it will be extended for a total duration of 4 years). This should lead to a dissertation (PhD thesis). We will draft an educational plan that includes attendance of courses and (international) meetings. We also expect you to assist in teaching undergraduates and master students. For this position the University Job Classification profile “Promovendus” (PhD candidate) applies. Your salary will be €2,901 gross per month in the first year and will increase to €3,707 in the final year, based on full-time employment of 38 hours per week. This does not include 8% holiday allowance and 8.3% year-end allowance.

The preferred starting date is between September and November of 2025.

For this position the University Job Classification profile “Promovendus” (PhD candidate) is applicable.

The Collective Labour Agreement of Universities of the Netherlands is applicable.

Besides the salary and a vibrant and challenging environment at Science Park we offer you multiple fringe benefits:
- 232 holiday hours per year (based on fulltime) and extra holidays between Christmas and 1 January;
- multiple courses to follow from our Teaching and Learning Centre;
- a complete educational program for PhD students;
- multiple courses on topics such as leadership for academic staff;
- multiple courses on topics such as time management, handling stress and an online learning platform with 100+ different courses;
- 7 weeks birth leave (partner leave) with 100% salary;
- partly paid parental leave;
- the possibility to set up a workplace at home;
- a pension at ABP for which UvA pays two third part of the contribution;
- the possibility to follow courses to learn Dutch;
- help with registration at UvA- Housing for a studio or small apartment when you’re moving from abroad. 

### Application
If you feel the profile fits you, and you are interested in the job, we look forward to receiving your application. You can apply online via the ‘Apply’-button on the vacancy’s webpage. We accept applications until and including 18 July.

Applications should include the following information (all files besides your cv should be submitted in one single pdf file):
- a detailed CV including the months (not just years) when referring to your education and work experience;
- a letter of motivation with a clear explanation of 1) why you are interested in the position, and 2) your relevant experience which makes you well suited for the position;
- the names and email addresses of two references who can provide letters of recommendation.

Only complete applications received within the response period via the link below will be considered.

A knowledge security check can be part of the selection procedure.

We will invite potential candidates for interviews soon after the closing date.
