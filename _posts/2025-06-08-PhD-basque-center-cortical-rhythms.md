- Research Field: Neuroscience
- Type of contract/Duration of Contract: Temporary: 4 years.

Speech processing and reading are essential unique human abilities underpinning social, educational, and professional advancement. However early biomarkers of speech processing deficits that have been documented in reading disabilities such as Developmental Dyslexia (DD) have yet to be identified. Here, we will explore whether the cortical tracking of speech (CTS) - the temporal alignment between fluctuations in the speech signal and fluctuations in electrical brain activity – can predict later reading deficits in DD. Cutting edge neuroimaging tools, carefully designed tasks, and longitudinal designs will be used to record CTS. Specifically, we will investigate whether CTS at an early age in speech processing and reading development (preschool years) can help detect early DD risks by predicting the children who will be diagnosed with DD later on (Grade 2 of primary school).

This project represents a radically new scientific approach that will break new ground by investigating CTS and will allow us to
1. Establish causal relationships between CTS and speech processing and reading skills
2. Use this novel approach to detect, diagnose and remediate DD.

### Job description
- Designing and implementing longitudinal studies in young children with and without familiar risk of DD
- Analysing electrophysiological recordings and EEG data during speech processing
- Writing research papers under the supervision of the PI, aiming to publish at top-tier journals
- Dissemination of results at international scientific conferences

### PI and research group
Dr. Marie Lallier and Dr, Marina Kalashnikova will be the supervisors of this PhD project. Both of these groups will be highly involved in the broader research team of this ERC Advanced Grant project, which has the aim of understand the role of CTS for language and reading acquisition from different perspectives (e.g., second language learning, illiteracy, training and remediation).

- Educational Neuroscience and Developmental Disorders – PI Marie Lallier

This group revolves around research lines aiming at elucidating the neurocognitive mechanisms subtending typical and atypical language and reading development and at transferring this knowledge to clinical and educational practice. To conduct research efficiently, they use various techniques (behavioral testing, eye tracking, fMRI, EEG, MEG) and designs (cross-linguistic, cross-sectional, longitudinal, and training studies) in bilingual and monolingual populations including infants, children, and adults, with and without language and reading disorders.

- Infant Language and Cognition – PI Marina Kalashnikova

This group investigates the process of early language acquisition, specifically the emergence and consolidation of speech perception and word-learning over monolingual and bilingual infants’ first two years of life, as well as interactions between these early language abilities and the development of general perceptual and cognitive capacities. The group addresses these questions through cross-sectional and longitudinal designs that combine neurophysiological (EEG, fNIRS), behavioral (visual preference, eye-tracking), and observational (parent-infant interactions) techniques in the BCBL BabyLab.

### Profile 
- Good knowledge of the field of cognitive neuroscience and/or linguistics, experimental psychology
- Master’s (or equivalent) degree in Psychology, Cognitive Neuroscience, Linguistics, and/or other relevant areas
- Experience with EEG signal analyses
- Strong background in experiment programming and statistical analyses
- Excellent written and oral communication skills in English
- Previous experience in participating in research projects (e.g., data collection, analysis) is desired
- Experience with research projects in children
- Knowledge of Spanish (or willingness to learn) is a plus

### Working conditions
Salary: 21,000€/year gross on average across the four years of the contract

Entitlements and other benefits: https://www.bcbl.eu/en/join-us/what-is-like-to-work-bcbl
