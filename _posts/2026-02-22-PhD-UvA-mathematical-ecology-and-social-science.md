description: Are you interested in integrating quantitative and qualitative approaches to better understand and mitigate tropical disease? Are you curious about conducting international research and working in a highly interdisciplinary team? The Institute of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics is looking for a highly motivated PhD to investigate the seasonality of a neglected tropical disease, schistosomiasis, and co-design intervention methods with communities most impacted.

### About the position
Despite decades of interventions, schistosomiasis remains a global public health challenge, delaying the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goal #3 “Ensure healthy lives and promote

well-being for all at all ages”. This snail-borne disease impacts >250 million people worldwide. However, the control of schistosomiasis is not prioritized over many other diseases as mortality is the result of decades-long chronic infections and it occurs primarily in low-income rural settings in the Global South. In order to tackle this global public health crisis, there is an urgent need for effective interventions that local communities want to use for their health and wellbeing. 

This PhD position will focus on understanding and harnessing the seasonality of the intermediate host of the schistosomiasis cycle: snails. The chosen candidate will (1) collect field and lab data on snail populations across a period of two years in collaboration with researchers in Tanzania, (2) they will adapt and apply mathematical models (ordinary differential equations, ODEs) to better understand how seasonality impacts snail populations and infection outcomes, and (3) work closely with local communities to develop locally-ground intervention methodologies informed by data and model outcomes.

The chosen candidate will be based in the SNAIL lab, led by Dr. Naima Starkloff in the Evolutionary and Population Biology (EPB) Department at the University of Amsterdam (UvA). The SNAIL lab uses ecological knowledge to tackle questions of public health importance in human modified landscapes. We work in close collaboration with researchers at the National Institute of Medical Research (NIMR) in Mwanza, Tanzania.

### What are you going to do?
Tasks and responsibilities:
- Co-designing and conducting field ecological surveys, lab experiments and social science surveys;
- Adapting and parameterizing existing ODE model;
- Conducting statistical analyses;
- Communicating with local and international researchers and stakeholders;
- Writing publications for peer-reviewed journals;
- Mentoring BSc and MSc students.

### Your profile
Your experience and profile:
- MSc in ecology, geography, life sciences, public health, environmental science or similar;
- Strong background in analytical skills, such as statistics, data management, etc. (strong preference for a candidate with a background in mathematical modeling);
- Experience in scripting/programming (e.g. R, Python);
- Background or strong interest in social science approaches, such as interviews, surveys, etc.;
- Interest, passion and experience in the ecological questions that impact human and/or environmental health and well-being;
- Proficiency in scientific writing;
- Experience or strong interest in international and interdisciplinary research;
- Ability to speak and communicate in English at an academic level.

### Our offer
A temporary contract for 38 hours per week for the duration of 4 years (the initial contract will be for a period of 18 months and after satisfactory evaluation it will be extended to the total duration of 4 years). The preferred starting date is by or before 1 May 2026. This should lead to a dissertation (PhD thesis). We will draft an educational plan that includes attendance of courses and (international) meetings. We also expect you to assist in teaching undergraduates and master students. For this position the University Job Classification profile “Promovendus” (PhD candidate) applies. Your salary will be €3,059 gross per month in the first year and will increase to €3,881 in the final year, based on full-time employment of 38 hours per week. In addition, you will receive a 8% holiday allowance and 8.3% year-end allowance.  

Besides the salary and a vibrant and challenging environment at Science Park we offer you multiple fringe benefits:
- 232 holiday hours per year (based on fulltime) and extra holidays between Christmas and 1 January;
- multiple courses to follow from our Teaching and Learning Centre;
- a complete educational program for PhD students;
- multiple courses on topics such as leadership for academic staff;
- multiple courses on topics such as time management, handling stress and an online learning platform with 100+ different courses;
- 7 weeks birth leave (partner leave) with 100% salary;
- partly paid parental leave;
- the possibility to set up a workplace at home;
- a pension at ABP for which UvA pays two third part of the contribution;
- the possibility to follow courses to learn Dutch;
- help with registration at UvA- Housing for a studio or small apartment when you’re moving from abroad. 

### Your application & contact
If you feel the profile fits you, and you are interested in the job, we look forward to receiving your application. You can apply online via the ‘Apply’-button on the vacancy’s webpage. We accept applications until and including 4 March 2026.
