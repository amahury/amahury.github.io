### About 
Nau mai haere mai ki tēnei hui!

The Capital City Complex Systems Symposium 2026 will explore cutting-edge knowledge of complex systems and complexity, and how this knowledge is being used to better understand systems and drive system change. It will be held in Te Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington, Aotearoa New Zealand, during summer in the Southern Hemisphere.

Ka mihi mātou ki ngā mana whenua o tēnei takiwā, ki a Taranaki whānui, me ngā hapū, iwi iwi katoa kua tau i kōnei, me ō rātou mahi whakahirahira, mahi tiaki i ngā taonga o ēnei whenua.

Te Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington, is the capital city of Aotearoa New Zealand. Māori have lived in Te Whanganui a Tara for 800 years. We acknowledge Taranaki whānui, and all the peoples who have lived here, and their close relationship with the lands and waters.

The theme for the conference is ‘Understanding complex systems: Theory, practice and impact’.

Following the success of previous symposia in 2023 and 2024, this event will continue to foster interdisciplinary, cross-sector and cross-society collaboration in complex systems thinking, research and action. In 2026, the symposium will integrate the latest insights from complex systems science with the pressing concerns facing communities, businesses, and policymakers today. A particular focus will be how complexity science has evolved and how it is informing contemporary actions and solutions for prosperous, resilient, equitable and democratic societies – amid growing global challenges.

The symposium will explore complexity through a rich interdisciplinary lens, bringing together philosophical and epistemological perspectives alongside practical insights from fields including artificial intelligence, infrastructure, health, education, climate, and the environment, and cutting-edge insights from Māori and local communities. Attendees will engage with understandings of complexity, examine innovative methods and tools for working within complex systems, and discuss the implications for public policy, governance, leadership and Indigenous system change.

This inclusive, supportive event is essential for anyone interested in understanding the trajectory and practical applications of complex systems knowledge — including researchers, leaders, policymakers, innovators, changemakers, practitioners, and students. Whether you’re deeply experienced in complex systems research or newly curious about its potential, the symposium will provide valuable insights, networking opportunities, and inspiration.

We are taking registrations for two optional pre-event workshops on Monday 23 February.
