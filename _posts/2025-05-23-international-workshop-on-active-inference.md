The 6th International Workshop on Active Inference (IWAI) wants to bring together researchers on active inference as well as related research fields in order to discuss current trends, novel results and real-world applications. We have an interest in exploring the extent to which active inference can be used in modern machine learning settings, such as in hybrid setups combining it with deep learning, as well as to unify the latest psychological and neurological insights, and to determine how it can best be used to understand action, optimization and decision making.

IWAI 2025 will focus on three core streams of Active Inference and Bayesian Brain research:
1. Computational Theory and Simulations: Mathematical and computational developments.
2. Cognitive, Philosophical, and Neural Models: Modeling biological, neural, and cognitive phenomena, and integrating applied philosophy.
3. Empirical, Clinical, and Real-World Applications: Data-driven studies applied to robotics, IoT, clinical, industrial, and societal challenges.

We look forward to your contributions and participation at IWAI 2025! For any questions, please contact us at david.benrimoh@mcgill.ca.

### Call for papers
Papers on all subjects and applications of active inference and related research areas are welcome. The workshop's focus is on the technical implementation of the ideas. Consequently, topics of interest include (but are not limited to):
- Active inference, theory and applications
- Predictive coding
- Hierarchical generative models
- Computational neuroscience
- Cognitive robotics
- Intelligent systems
- Neuroeconomics
- Cognitive science
- Decision making

### Paper submissions
Submissions can be either full papers or extended abstracts. All contributions should be in PDF format and include an abstract of maximum 250 words.

- Full paper submissions must be anonymized and have up to 12-pages in the LNCS format (click here for details), including figures but excluding references.
- Extended abstracts have up to 2 pages excluding references and figures. These submissions can cover the material of a journal paper published by the author in the past 12 months, or can present late breaking results.

Submit your full paper or extended abstract via OpenReview. On the submission page, authors should indicate the desired stream and submission format.

All submitted full papers will undergo a rigorous double-blind peer review process, and be selected based on originality, quality, soundness, and relevance. Submitted papers need to be anonymized with the best of efforts. It is allowed to have a (non-anonymous) online pre-print. Accepted papers will be published in the proceedings in the Springer CCIS series.

Full paper submissions may also be accepted only as posters with a 3-minute spotlight. Accepted extended abstracts are presented as posters with a 3-minute spotlight. Exceptionally promising extended abstracts may be selected for presentation as 15-minute talks.
