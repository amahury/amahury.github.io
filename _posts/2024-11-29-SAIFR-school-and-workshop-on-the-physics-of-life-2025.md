### General info
Through minicourses and research seminars and discussion sessions, this school and workshop will explore the fundamental physical principles that govern living systems across scales, from macromolecules to birds. Minicourse topics during the school will include:
- Molecular and Cell Biophysics
- Neurophysics
- Dynamical Systems and Collective Motion
- Machine Learning Tools for Biological Physics

The school is designed for graduate students interested in the intersection of physics and life sciences from a physics perspective. Leading experts will deliver in-depth lectures on cutting-edge experiments, theoretical frameworks, and emerging trends in the field.

Immediately following the school there will be a 3-day workshop with invited seminars by researchers from Latin America, as well as discussion sessions addressing how to build a network of biological physicists in the region.

Applicants are invited to submit abstracts for poster presentations during both the school and workshop.

There is no registration fee. Limited funding is available to support travel and local expenses for school participants and local expenses for workshop participants.

### Lecturers
- Olga Dudko (University of California at San Diego, USA) – How living systems accomplish things on time: beating the speed limit in genomic interactions, viral infection, and neuronal communication
- Gabriel B. Mindlin (Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina) – Artificial intelligence and dynamics applied to biophysics: the case of birdsong
- Tomás S. Grigera (Universidad Nacional de La Plata, Argentina) – Statistical physics of collective motion
- Faruck Morcos (University of Texas at Dallas, USA) – From biomolecular prediction to design, the impact of machine learning in biological physics


### Deadlines
- Application deadline for school: January 11, 2025
- Application deadline for workshop: February 17, 2025
