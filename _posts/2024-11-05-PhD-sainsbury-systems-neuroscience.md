### Why study at Sainsbury Wellcome Center (SWC)?
Joining the SWC PhD Programme gives you the opportunity of doing your PhD at one of the outstanding systems neuroscience labs at the SWC.

In addition, our students receive a comprehensive introduction to systems neuroscience, as well as intensive training in experimental techniques, including imaging, physiology, molecular, and behavioural methods in systems neuroscience.

Students in the programme are taught and supervised by SWC faculty together with colleagues at the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit and other affiliated institutions, all experts in their respective fields.  Gatsby and SWC students overlap extensively during the programme, building the foundations for long-lasting collaborations and friendships.

You will live and work in central London, with the highest concentration of neuroscience research in the world.

SWC students receive an annual stipend starting at £28,400 in year one, as well as funds to attend international courses or meetings. We also cover the cost of tuition fees for home as well as international students.

The SWC PhD is your opportunity to receive world-class training as a neuroscientist and launch an exciting career in academia or industry. Apply now to join our pool of exceptional students from around the globe!
