### Workshops and Tutorials
We invite you to submit a proposal for a workshop or tutorial at ALIFE 2026 “Living and Lifelike Complex Adaptive Systems”, which will be held from August 17 to 21 in Waterloo, Canada.

Tutorials cover current topics relevant to the artificial life community, such as an introduction to state-of-the-art methods and software. Each tutorial slot will be 1.5 hours long. We encourage tutorial organizers to maintain a website that collects the content, demos, and interactive material.

Workshops aim to promote and discuss new ideas and topics in the field of artificial life in a more informal context and might be organized as invited talks, panel discussions, or contributed talks.

ALIFE will provide the on-site logistics and links from the main conference website. The tutorial and workshop organizers are responsible for all other organizational issues.

If you are interested in organizing a workshop or tutorial, please send your proposal in a single file specifying:
- The type of contribution (workshop or tutorial);
- Name and affiliation of the organizers, with a valid email address;
- A short bio or CV of the organizers;
- A proposal describing the content and its importance for the ALIFE community (150~250 words);
- The expected number of participants (for our logistics);
- Workshop only: Planned duration, i.e., one or two 90-minutes slots.

Submit proposals with all the above information as a single pdf to [https://ssl.linklings.net/conferences/ALIFE/](https://ssl.linklings.net/conferences/ALIFE/)

Contact program2026@alife.org for any queries. More details about the conference can be found at [https://2026.alife.org](https://2026.alife.org)

### Call for Special Sessions
Special sessions will be specially-themed tracks in the main conference. The idea is to attract high-quality submissions on topics of particular interest to our community. We are particularly interested in sessions that will set new directions for future research and bring new voices into our community. These sessions will be part of the main conference and will run alongside other conference sessions.

Organizing a special session provides an opportunity to explore in depth a particular topic within the main conference, and to bring new ideas and new people into the ALife community. We are open to any ideas you might have that might create a buzz around your topic or the conference in general, such as advertising the session outside of the usual ALife community or holding panel or group discussions as part of the session.

Submissions to your session will go through the main conference review system. As a session organizer, you would set the topic of the session, attract submissions through whatever means you wish, and chair the session at the conference.

Please note that special sessions are different from workshops. The main difference is that special sessions are part of the main conference – they share its review process and accepted submissions will appear in the proceedings. There will also be workshop sessions at ALIFE 2025, and a call for workshop proposals will be sent out separately.
‍
We welcome session proposals on any topic. Every special session proposal should include:
- Title of the special session
- Name(s) and affiliation(s) of the organizer(s) with contact details
- Short bio or CV of the organizer(s)
- Description of the session theme, including why this session theme deserves special attention from the ALife community (about 250 words)
- What you propose to do to support the session, such as advertising it or in terms of organisation (about 150 words)
- List of 3-5 senior reviewers suggestions relevant for your session
- Submit proposal with all the above information in a single pdf at https://ssl.linklings.net/conferences/ALIFE/
