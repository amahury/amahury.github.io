The Department of Mathematics at Dartmouth College invites applications for a full-time tenure-track appointment at the rank of Assistant Professor, with initial appointment as early as July 1, 2025. We seek applicants with expertise in mathematical data science, including statistical data science methods. Current research areas in the department span both pure mathematics (algebra and number theory, combinatorics and discrete mathematics, functional analysis, geometry, and topology) and applied mathematics (complex systems, computational mathematics, dynamical systems, machine learning, mathematical biology, probability, and uncertainty quantification and data assimilation).

Located in Hanover, New Hampshire, Dartmouth College is an Ivy League university that offers students and faculty a close-knit academic community with global reach. Part of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the Department of Mathematics (http://www.math.dartmouth.edu) is home to 24 tenured and tenure-track faculty members, a strong PhD program, and outstanding undergraduate students. Beyond our department, our graduate students and postdoctoral scholars are supported by the Guarini School for Graduate and Advanced Studies, including their diversity and inclusion initiatives. For tenure-track faculty, the departmental classroom teaching responsibility is three courses spread over four ten-week terms. Members of the department have collaborative connections across campus. To create an atmosphere supportive of research, Dartmouth offers new faculty members grants for research-related expenses, one term of sabbatical leave for each three academic years in residence, and flexible scheduling of teaching responsibilities.

Dartmouth is committed to academic excellence and encourages the open exchange of ideas within a culture of mutual respect. People with different backgrounds, life experiences, and perspectives make the Dartmouth community diverse, which enhances academic excellence. In addition, we value applicants who have a demonstrated ability to contribute to Dartmouth’s undergraduate diversity initiatives in STEM research, such as the Women in Science Program, E. E. Just STEM Scholars Program, and Academic Summer Undergraduate Research Experience (ASURE). Applicants should include a statement that addresses how their research, teaching, service, and/or life experiences prepare them to advance Dartmouth’s commitment to diversity in service of academic excellence.

Qualifications: A Ph.D. (or equivalent degree) in Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, Statistics, or a closely related field (such as Computer Science, Biostatistics, etc.). Qualified candidates will have a strong research record and the promise of continuing a high level of research activity, a keen interest and demonstrated excellence in classroom teaching as well as the mentorship of both undergraduates and graduate students, and a strong and proven commitment to fostering a diverse, equitable and inclusive college campus at all scales.

Application Instructions: Please submit all materials electronically via MathJobs [APMDS #24925]. Letters may be addressed to the Mathematical Data Science Search Committee. Applicants should submit: 1) Letter of application; 2) Curriculum vitae; 3) Statement of research results and interests; 4) Statement of pedagogical philosophy and experience, including mentoring of student projects; 5) Statement addressing how the applicant’s research, teaching, service, and/or life experiences prepare them to advance Dartmouth’s commitment to diversity in service of academic excellence; and 6) Four (4) letters of reference, at least one of which specifically addresses teaching and, if possible, mentoring of student projects.

Review of applications will begin on October 15, 2024 and continue until the position is filled. General inquiries can be sent to Tracy Moloney (tfmoloney@math.dartmouth.edu). Specific questions regarding the selection process can be sent to Prof. Peter Mucha as the chair of the search committee (Peter.J.Mucha@dartmouth.edu).
