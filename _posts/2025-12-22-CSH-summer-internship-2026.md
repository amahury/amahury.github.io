Many of the most important challenges facing society today are unprecedented and so complex that they can only be solved by innovative and highly transdisciplinary approaches – complexity science. Complexity science integrates high-dimensional, real-world data analysis and computational modeling to deliver insights to the systems that underlie our world. Join us for an internship and gain first-hand experience with complex systems research and its foundational theories and tools.

### Program Goals
A summer internship at CSH enables students to:
- Conduct complexity science research as part of a CSH team
- Explore the the latest developments, applications, and challenges of complex systems science
- Learn knowledge and skills to enhance their capacity as a complexity scientist
- Connect with fellow interns, CSH researchers, and our many scientific visitors to expand their complexity science network

### Structure
The CSH summer internship consists of: 
- independent complexity science project
- individualized training from dedicated project advisor(s)
- scientific talks and research seminars
- introductory skills and foundations workshops
- a limited number of intern-only social activities
- project presentation to the CSH community

The core of the internship experience is the project and the close collaboration with the project advisor(s). The project advisors, along with other members of the research team, will help with technical aspects of the project and provide regular opportunities to discuss bigger-picture elements of the work. Advisors provide reading lists and additional learning resources so that students can enhance their knowledge and skills related to the project. Students will also have access to a range of workshops, seminars, and talks to help them gain knowledge about complexity science and current areas of research. 

### Timeline & Milestones
Internships are expected to begin in late June 2026 and last 6–10 weeks. At the beginning of the internship period, students will meet with their project advisor(s) to develop a set of discrete goals and a timeline for their project. The internship is considered a full-time commitment for its duration. In the first several weeks of the program, interns will be offered short introductory skills and foundations workshops, aimed at providing knowledge that will help students manage their projects and incorporate complex systems approaches. Students will continue their self-directed learning throughout the summer, with the guidance of their advisor(s). All interns are invited to present their project to the CSH community at the end of the summer.

### Audience
Students enrolled in either Bachelors or Masters studies are eligible. Bachelors students should have completed at least 1 year of study by the time of the internship. Neither prior independent research experience nor extensive familiarity with complexity science methods is expected; the internship is a learning experience.

We encourage applications from women and persons from groups that have been historically excluded from the sciences. This is an in-person program; accepted fellows are expected to spend the internship period in Vienna, Austria. 

There are no restrictions on citizenship or residency. Non-EU citizens should be prepared to provide documentation of their university enrollment and course of study, and to obtain any necessary visas. Students who are accepted into the program and who require a visa will be provided the necessary supporting documents for their application.

### Eligibility
At the time of their participation, interns should be enrolled in a degree-granting Bachelors, Masters, or combined degree program from an accredited institution; or should be planning to re-enroll in such a program within the next 12 months. In addition, applicants should have:
- Prior coursework in a quantitative discipline (social, natural or information sciences, mathematics, engineering)
- Programming experience (Python or R skills are an asset) or experience with statistical analysis platforms.
- Proficiency in English*
- Availability for 6–10 weeks in the time period June 15 – September 1, 2026. Internships outside of this time are not possible. 

Graduate students interested in conducting independent research at CSH are encouraged to consider the Visiting Student Program, which accepts applications on a rolling basis.

### Funding
An internship at CSH is structured as a learning experience for the benefit of the student and is therefore unpaid. Interns must provide for their travel to, from, and within Vienna, accommodations, and meals. Interns must also ensure that they have health (accident) insurance that provides sufficient coverage in Austria. Students should also consider possible additional costs related to visas, mobile phone coverage, and other personal costs. Though circumstances will vary, interns should budget EUR 1600–1800 for a two-month internship, plus the cost of travel from/to their place of residence.

Students are encouraged to seek funding from their home university to support their internship experience, for instance, through Erasmus+ (EU) or similar programs. CSH can provide supporting documents to students who are accepted into the program.

### How to Apply
The application deadline for internships is January 13, 2026 (midnight Vienna local time). Late applications cannot be accepted.

Available internship projects are described here.

Apply through our online application portal here. Applicants will provide: (1) biographical information, (2) general details of academic background, (3) curriculum vitae or resume, and (4) a cover letter that addresses the following points:
- Describe any job experiences, coursework, hobbies, skills, degrees, certifications, or licenses that you have that might be relevant during this internship.
- Describe your vision as a young scientist. What problem(s) would you like to solve? If your interest is in data visualization, what do you hope to achieve with your work?
- Describe what interests you about a specific project and how it fits into your scientific vision. Describe how this internship could be useful towards realizing your scientific (or other) goals.

Candidates may be contacted for an online interview in February 2026. All candidates will be notified of their application status no later than mid-March.

### Contact
Carrie Cowan and Julia Emmerling lead the internship program and support students with all aspects of their experience at CSH. Please contact grad@csh.ac.at with any questions.
