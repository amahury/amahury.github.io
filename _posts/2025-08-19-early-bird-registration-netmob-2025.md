### Main Conference
The 2025 edition marks the 9th edition of NetMob, continuing a tradition that began in 2010. Following the great success of NetMob 2024 held at the World Bank Group Main Campus in Washington, D.C., the NetMob community has established itself as a leading platform for advancing mobile data analytics.

The upcoming NetMob 2025 edition will take place in Paris, France, in October 2025, bringing together researchers, industry professionals, and policymakers to explore the latest mobile network data analysis advancements. Topics will cover various aspects of mobile data analytics, including Call Detail Records (CDRs), mobile location data, Wi-Fi traces, app usage statistics, and social media content analytics.

As in previous years, NetMob 2025 will feature a single-track format with short contributed talks, providing a platform for presenting early-stage research and studies published elsewhere.

### Data Challenge
Colocated with NetMob 2025, we are launching the new edition of the Data Challenge page. This initiative continues to foster research and innovation around mobility data, encouraging both methodological advances and practical applications that address pressing urban and societal challenges.

For this year’s edition, we are excited to release a unique dataset from a GNSS-based mobility survey conducted in the Île-de-France region (Greater Paris area). This high-resolution dataset captures the mobility behavior of over 3,300 volunteered participants between October 2022 and May 2023. Volunteers consented to the data collection and were equipped with dedicated GPS tracking devices for seven consecutive days and maintained digital (or optional paper) travel diaries, with all information validated through follow-up phone interviews.

### When & Where & How
NetMob 2025 will take place in October 2025 at the Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers (CNAM) in Paris, France. Located in the heart of the city, CNAM is a historic institution known for its contributions to science and technology.

Venue address: Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers (CNAM) 292 Rue Saint-Martin, 75003 Paris, France

The campus can be reached via public transport by:
- Metro Line 11, to "Arts et Métiers" station

### Visa & Logistics
Citizens of the Member States of the European Union, as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland, may enter France with their national identity card or a valid passport.

If you are a non-EU citizen and plan to attend NetMob 2025 in Paris, you may be required to obtain a visa. The most common visa type for conference attendees is the short-stay Schengen visa, which allows stays of up to 90 days within a 180-day period. This visa is issued for purposes including tourism, business meetings, study programs under 3 months, and participation in scientific, cultural, or artistic events.

You can consult the official French visa website for detailed eligibility and application instructions: https://france-visas.gouv.fr/

We strongly encourage participants requiring a visa to start the application process as early as possible.

As part of your visa application, you may be asked to provide a visa support letter.

To request one, please complete your conference registration and payment. If not already specified on the registration form, send an email to the NetMob 2025 organizers at netmob2025-Sgrant@inria.fr with the following information:
- Your full name as it appears on your passport
- Your passport number and date of birth
- Your current postal mailing address
- Your registration confirmation number
- If applicable, the title of your accepted abstract and whether you are the “sole author” or a “co-author”

Requests will be processed in the order received. You will receive a PDF version of the support letter within 4–5 business days. If needed, a printed version can be mailed to your address. However, the PDF is sufficient for most visa applications.

Note: Visa support letters will only be issued to participants who have completed their registration and payment. If a participant later withdraws, the appropriate authorities may be informed.

### Registration
