### General Information
The IEEE International Conference on Development and Learning (ICDL) is a unique conference gathering researchers from computer science, robotics, psychology, neuroscience, and other disciplines to share and discuss research on how humans and other animals learn and develop and how this can inform and be informed by robotics and machine learning systems.

In 2026, the IEEE ICDL will be hosted at Kyoto University, a world-class institution celebrated for its commitment to interdisciplinary inquiry. Set in the historic city of Kyoto, this conference offers a unique opportunity to deepen our understanding of human, animal, and machine development through cross-disciplinary collaboration in an inspiring environment.

The IEEE Robotics and Automation Society is committed to advancing diversity in Robotics and Automation, and to promoting an inclusive and equitable culture that welcomes, engages, and rewards all who contribute to the field, without regard to ethnicity, religion, gender, disability, age, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.

### Call for Contributions
The IEEE ICDL 2026 invites a broad range of contributions that advance our understanding of the development and learning of intelligent systems—both natural and artificial. The IEEE ICDL 2026 brings together researchers from developmental science, neuroscience, psychology, cognitive science, robotics, and artificial intelligence, fostering interdisciplinary dialogue on embodied, cognitive, and lifelong learning.

The topics of the IEEE ICDL 2026 include, but are not limited to:
- General principles and theories of development and learning
- Embodied learning in biological systems and robots
- Development of motor, perceptual, and cognitive skills
- Developmental stages and sensitive periods
- Architectures for cognitive development and lifelong learning
- Emergence of body knowledge and affordance perception
- Motor learning and control of body movements
- Curiosity, intrinsic motivation, exploration, play, and active learning
- Prediction, planning, and problem solving
- Developmentally inspired machine learning
- Applications of machine learning to human and animal development
- AI and machine learning methods for developmental and behavioral sciences
- Emotional development and the role of emotion in learning
- Emergence of verbal and nonverbal communication
- Metacognitive skills and explicit communication
- Human–human and human–system interaction models
- Epistemological and philosophical foundations
- Relationships between evolution and development
- Ethics in modeling learning and development

The IEEE ICDL 2026 invites submissions to the following three categories:
- Full Paper (6 pages; up to 2 additional pages with extra charges)
- Late-Breaking Result (1–2 pages)
- Journal Presentation

All submissions must be in English.

The IEEE ICDL 2026 also invites proposals for workshops or tutorials to be held on the first day of the conference (15 September 2026). These events support focused community discussion and knowledge exchange. Proposals may optionally include a competition component. Submitted proposals will be reviewed by the Program Chairs.

Proposals must be submitted as a PDF document of up to 3 pages (A4 size) and should include the following information:
- Title
- Organizers (names, affiliations, contact information)
- Duration (half-day or full-day)
- Motivation and objectives
- Content and relevance to ICDL
- Target audience
- List of speakers (confirmed or tentative)
- Tentative schedule
- (If applicable) brief description of the competition
