Do you have a great research idea but need the right people to bring it to life? Help us make Complexity72h an unforgettable experience again by applying to be a tutor in Madrid next June. The call for tutors is now open!

We’re looking for project proposals from experienced researchers to be developed over 72 hours by a team of 6-8 workshop participants. 

At this stage, your proposal doesn’t need to be highly detailed, but it should clearly outline what you plan to work on. You can find an example of what we expect here. Be sure to include the data you will use, as it’s your responsibility to provide it to participants.

If your project is selected, your abstract will be posted online (with an opportunity to edit it beforehand). Please note that we cannot guarantee that all tutors or projects will be accepted, as this depends on the number of workshop participants selecting each project. The final list of accepted tutors and projects will be announced by the end of March.

Please submit your application by January 7th, 2025!
