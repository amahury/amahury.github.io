SfNC 2025’s theme, Creativity & Changing Brains, will investigate how creativity both drives and is driven by changes in the brain, whether those changes occur in clinical, developmental, or everyday contexts. 

This theme is inspired by the history of our venue - Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital (at the Paris Brain Institute) is the location where Paul Broca’s studies of brain lesions led to his discovery of the seat of language production in the human brain and laid the groundwork for modern neuropsychology and cognitive neuroscience. 

### Submission
SfNC invites submissions about research on creativity using neuroscience and neuroimaging methods, as well as psychological, behavioral, social, humanist, and historical approaches. Scientific abstracts should be primarily be empirical and will be evaluated based on scientific quality. Submissions on data still being collected or analyzed will be considered, though please indicate so in the body of the abstract. 

Each year, SfNC also considers talks and demonstrations from members outside the scientific community in the arts, humanities, education, industry, and other practitioners and stakeholders in human creativity research. Please follow the same abstract submission process and describe your proposed presentation and its value to the SfNC community. Ensure to check the box indicating that your proposal is not empirical. 

**The window for abstract submissions for talks and posters will be from December 3rd, 2024 - January 17th, 2025, and acceptance decisions will be sent out by the first week of February 2025.**

The form to submit abstracts is available through our member website. Individuals must be an SfNC member to submit an abstract. SfNC Academic Faculty members may submit abstracts on behalf of their students and lab, though all individuals must be an SfNC member to attend the conference if accepted.

### Registration
Registration for the conference will open in February 2025. 

**NOTE**: As of December 1, 2024, all SfNC membership benefits have been moved to our new member site, which is a different system than our previous membership service. Our annual membership fees have not changed. Active membership for the 2025 year using the new system is required to access the member site to submit conference abstracts or view previous event recordings in our member archives. 

If you purchased or renewed your annual SfNC membership between June 1, 2024 and November 30th, 2024, your current membership will be honored and you will receive instructions via email for how to access the new system. 

We will be able to provide advance decisions on submitted abstracts due to travel, funding, and visa planning requirements by request. If you require advance notice, please indicate so in your abstract submission form.
