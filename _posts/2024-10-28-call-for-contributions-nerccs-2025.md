NERCCS 2025: The Eighth Northeast Regional Conference on Complex Systems will follow the success of the previous NERCCS conferences to promote the emerging venue of interdisciplinary scholarly exchange for complex systems researchers in the Northeast U.S. region (and beyond) to share their research outcomes through presentations and online publications, network with their peers, and promote interdisciplinary collaboration and the growth of the research community.

NERCCS will particularly focus on facilitating the professional growth of early career faculty, postdocs, and students in the region who will likely play a leading role in the field of complex systems science and engineering in the coming years.

The 2025 conference will be held primarily in person in the Innovative Technologies Complex at Binghamton University, with an online participation option via Zoom.

### Topics
We call for submissions for oral and poster presentations on a wide variety of complex systems research. Relevant topics include (but are not limited to):
- Theoretical foundations of complex systems
- Nonlinear dynamics and chaos
- Systems theory, information theory, and systems science
- Game theory, decision theory, and socio-economical applications
- Self-organization, pattern formation, and collective behavior
- Structure and dynamics of complex networks
- Sustainability and adaptability of complex systems
- Bio-inspired systems, machine learning, and evolutionary computation
- Data-driven approaches to complex systems
- Applications to the humanities, art, and literature
- Historical and philosophical aspects of complex systems
- Complex systems and education

Full paper submission has an earlier deadline to allow for rigorous full-paper peer reviews, and if accepted, the papers will be published in Northeast Journal of Complex Systems (NEJCS) by the time of the conference (free of charge). Interested authors can contact the Publication Chairs (Georgi Georgiev and Bernard Ricca).

Best Oral Presentation / Best Poster (Interactive Presentation) Awards: NERCCS 2025 will offer the Best Oral Presentation and Best Poster Awards. The winner will be selected from accepted papers and posters by the judge panel, which will be recognized with a certificate at the conference.
