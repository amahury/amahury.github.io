### About
Computational Neuroscience and Inference from data are disciplines that extensively use tools from Mathematics and Physics to understand the behavior of model neuronal networks and analyze data from real experiments. Due to its interdisciplinary nature and the complexity of the neuronal networks, the list of techniques that are borrowed from Physics and Mathematics is an extensive one. Although using tools from standard curriculum of Physics, Mathematics and Engineering is common, more advanced research requires methods and techniques that are not usually covered in any single discipline. 

To fill in this gap, this summer school covers some of the most important methods used in computational neuroscience research through both main lectures and scientific seminars (5-6 main lectures per topic and  1-2 seminars by each invited seminar speaker).

Organizers: Ines Samengo, Nicolai Waniek, and Ivan Davidovich.

### Requirements
The deadline for applications is March 31st at 11:59PM CET. The results of the selection process will be communicated by email around mid April.

The summer school is aimed at PhD students, but Master's students who are expected to have defended their thesis by the time the school starts and postdocs in their first year are also welcome to apply.

We will select a number of students to attend the school in accordance to our budget. Students are required to attend the whole period of the school, arriving on July 7th and departing on July 25th. A shuttle service at a pre-arranged time will be provided on those dates between Molde and the Fred Kavli Knowledge Center, where the school will take place. Students who are not members of NRSN will need to cover the costs of their travel to and from Molde. NRSN students should check how to get your travel expenses covered. The costs of accommodation and food will be covered by the school (except for alcohol). Students should expect to be assigned a shared bedroom.

There are no registration fees for the school. Accommodation and food (except for alcohol) will be covered by the school for all students selected to participate. Participating students must attend the school in person for its whole duration. Students should expect to be assigned a shared bedroom.

Ground transportation between Molde and the Fred Kavli Knowledge Center will be provided by the school on a pre-determined schedule on both arrival and departure days (July 7th and 25th, respectively).

Non-NRSN students: Students that don't belong to NRSN will need to find their own funding to cover their travel expenses from their place of residence to Molde (and back).

NRSN students: NRSN can cover your travel expenses. Please check https://www.ntnu.edu/nrsn/grants.
