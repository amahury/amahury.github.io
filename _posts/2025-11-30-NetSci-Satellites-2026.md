### General Information 
NetSci 2026 will host multiple Satellite symposia as half-day or full-day meetings focused on specific topics in network science and its applications. Satellites are community-organized, topic-driven events that complement the main program and foster deep discussion and new collaborations.

Organizer Benefit: Full-day satellites receive one complimentary registration for NetSci 2026 (which may be used for an invited speaker or organizer).

### Satellite Submission
Please submit a single PDF (maximum 2 pages) containing:
- Title – a descriptive title for the satellite
- Abstract – a brief summary of the topic, aims, and expected outcomes
- Organizers & Contact – names, affiliations, and emails of all organizers; designate one spokesperson/contact
- Preferred Format – half-day or full-day; planned structure (sessions/panels), expected number of speakers/participants, and a preliminary program; if applicable, note attendance at previous editions
- Preliminary Speakers – list confirmed or pre-contacted speakers (this strengthens the proposal)
- Submission method: Email proposals to satellites@netsci2026.com with a subject line that includes “[SATELLITE SUBMISSION] …” followed by the name of your satellite.
- Submission Deadline: December 8, 2025 (anywhere on Earth)
- Notification of Acceptance: December 22, 2025 (expected)

### Review & Selection
Proposals will be evaluated by the Satellites Committee based on:​
- Clarity and coherence of topic and goals
- Scholarly significance and community interest
- Diversity and inclusivity of organizers/speakers
- Feasibility of format and program

Final scheduling and room assignments will be coordinated by the conference organizers.

### Organizer Responsibilities
- Manage speaker invitations, abstract collection (if any), and session moderation
- Provide a finalized program, speaker list, and time blocks by the deadline set after acceptance
- Coordinate any satellite-specific communications (the conference will list your event on the website and program)
