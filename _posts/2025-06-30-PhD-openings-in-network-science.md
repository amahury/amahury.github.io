### Job description
We’d like to announce applications for two Ph.D. positions associated with the NWO (ENW-M2) funded project `Redefining renormalization for complex networks‘ to commence in September of 2025. The positions will be individually supervised by Prof. Diego Garlaschelli and Dr. Subodh Patil at the Lorentz Institute for Theoretical Physics at Leiden University. Applicants are expected to have a master’s degree in any of the natural sciences, mathematics, computer science, or other related subjects, and should have, or be scheduled to have obtained their degree around the starting date of the appointment. We particularly welcome strong applicants with an appetite for interdisciplinary thinking grounded in quantitative modeling and analysis, particularly those with a background in theoretical sciences, broadly defined.

The perspective candidates will work on projects broadly concerned tackling foundational issues concerning the renormalization and generalized statistical mechanics of complex networks. The applicant will be joining a vibrant and active research ecosystem, with frequent interactions with our colleagues at other institutes in the Netherlands and across Europe.

We offer a full-time position initially for one year, and after a positive evaluation of the progress of the thesis, personal capabilities and compatibility the appointment will be extended by a further three years. Salaries range from €2872 to €3670 gross per month (pay scale P in accordance with the Collective Labor Agreement for Dutch Universities). Leiden University offers an attractive benefits package with additional holiday (8%) and end-of-year bonuses (8.3 %), training and career development and sabbatical leave. Our individual choices model gives you some freedom to assemble your own set of terms and conditions. Candidates from outside the Netherlands may be eligible for a substantial tax break.

All our PhD students are embedded in the Leiden University Graduate School of Science. Our graduate school offers several PhD training courses at three levels: professional courses, skills training and personal effectiveness. In addition, advanced courses to deepen scientific knowledge are offered by the research school.

### Applications
To apply for this vacancy, please send an email to both patil@lorentz.leidenuniv.nl and garlaschelli@lorentz.leidenuniv.nl, and include the following documents:
- Curriculum Vitae

- In addition, please arrange for two letters of reference to be sent to both patil@lorentz.leidenuniv.nl and garlaschelli@lorentz.leidenuniv.nl with the applicant’s surname in the subject line.

The deadline for all application materials including recommendation letters is July 15 2025. Any inquiries can be directed to either garlaschelli@lorentz.leidenuniv.nl, or patil@lorentz.leidenuniv.nl
