### Summer School
How can networks help us identify critical relationships in biomedical systems? How can we uncover hidden connections between genes and predict disease pathways? How can visualizing medical data improve diagnostics and treatment outcomes? How can machine learning and deep learning models transform the analysis of complex medical data?

If you're eager to explore these questions, join us at the Biomedical Data Science Summer School! This program equips participants with the theoretical foundation and practical skills to apply network science, data visualization, and machine learning to real-world biomedical challenges.

The curriculum focuses on four key areas:
1. Biomedical Network Science: Learn how networks can model relationships between genes, proteins, diseases, and patient data to uncover patterns and predict interactions.
2. Medical Data Visualization: Explore practical methods for creating clear, interactive visualizations of complex medical datasets, improving interpretability and decision-making.
3. Machine Learning on Tabular Medical Data: Apply machine learning techniques to structured datasets, such as electronic health records, to predict outcomes and identify risk factors.
4. Deep Learning on Unstructured Medical Data: Gain hands-on experience with deep learning models to analyze unstructured data, including medical images, text, and genomic sequences.

### Conference
On behalf of the Institute of Biostatistics and Network Science, we are delighted to invite you to the 1st Biomedical Data Science Conference (BIOMED-DATA 25), taking place at Semmelweis University in Budapest, Hungary, from August 6 to 8, 2025. We welcome researchers to join us as presenters or participants, engaging in discussions on cutting-edge topics in biomedical data science.

The conference welcomes papers addressing data-intensive biological and medical research challenges, with a focus on developing novel methodologies to advance biomedical science discovery, including but not limited to:
- Machine learning and AI applications in biomedical research
- Multi-omics data integration and analysis
- Medical imaging and computer vision in healthcare
- Natural language processing for clinical and biomedical texts
- Explainable AI and trustworthy machine learning in medicine
- Computational modeling of biological systems
- Wearable and sensor-based health data analytics
- Privacy-preserving techniques for biomedical data
- Digital health and personalized medicine
- Drug discovery and biomarker identification through data science
- Network science tools in biomedical research
- Causal inference in biomedical research
- Biostatistical approaches for biomedical data analysis

The conference also offers valuable networking opportunities, including a Welcome Reception with an Exhibition Talk on Wednesday and, of course, the Conference Dinner on Thursday.

Note that the Conference Abstract Book will be published with an ISBN number.

### Abstract Submission
We invite submissions for the Biomedical Data Science Conference in three presentation formats:
- Regular Talk – Full-length presentation
- Lightning Talk – Short, focused presentation
- Poster – Visual presentation and discussion

During submission, authors can indicate their preferred format(s), but final acceptance and presentation type will be determined by the program committee based on availability and fit.

We kindly ask that abstracts be submitted on the abstract submission page. Each author may present a maximum of two abstracts; however, there are no restrictions on co-authorship or the total number of abstracts submitted. All abstracts must be submitted in English. Please do not submit duplicate copies of the same abstract. All abstracts will be forwarded to the Scientific Program Committee for review.

After the review by the Scientific Program Committee, the authors will be notified of the results by May 7, 2025.

If an abstract is accepted, the presenter must register and pay the registration fee by July 4, 2025, for the abstract to be included in the conference program. For the payment details, scroll down to the next section or check the REGISTRATION page.
