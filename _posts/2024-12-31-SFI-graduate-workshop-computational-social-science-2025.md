### Program Overview
The Graduate Workshop in Computational Social Science Modeling and Complexity brings together a group of advanced Ph.D. students and a small faculty for an intensive two-week study of computational social science modeling and complexity. Participants will learn how to apply tools and approaches from complex systems and computation to questions in the social sciences, while advancing their independent research and working collaboratively with fellow participants. The Workshop convenes in-person and consists of seminars, independent research, formal and informal discussions, and a hackathon-style challenge.

### Dates & Times
**Expected Dates: June 22 - July 4, 2025**

The Workshop is a full-time (all-day) commitment. All participants are expected to attend the entire program in person.

### Registration Fee
Registration fee: $2,475. The registration fee for the program covers course-associated costs, materials, and accommodations plus breakfast and lunch each weekday. Students are responsible for the cost of travel and for evening/weekend meals during the program.

### Program Goals
- Collaborate on an intensive, hackathon-style problem as a member of a team composed of fellow program participants.
- Advance independent Ph.D. research with guidance from program faculty and insight from peers.
- Connect with social scientists interested in computation and complexity and identify future collaborators and colleagues.
- Explore a breadth of current topics in computational social science and complexity research.

### Venue
The program will take place in the Schwartz House on the beautiful and historic campus of the School for Advanced Research (SAR) within walking distance of downtown Santa Fe. Each student will have a private bedroom in the house. The workshop will take place in the communal space which can be used for working and socializing. Two days will be spent at the Santa Fe Institute.

### Audience
The Workshop is aimed at Ph.D. students who ideally have completed a minimum of two years of Ph.D. study (or equivalent research experience) and are actively pursuing thesis research in computational social science. Participation in the workshop is limited to 10 students. Early career researchers including postdocs and new faculty will be considered. 

Applicants from any country are welcome. Accepted applicants who are not US citizens or permanent residents will receive assistance with visa sponsorship as appropriate to their individual circumstances.

The Workshop team is committed to offering inclusive educational programs in which all participants feel valued and supported in their learning journey. We believe that human diversity in all of its dimensions is essential to meaningful scientific progress. We believe that open discourse and respectful sharing of broad perspectives is essential for understanding our world. We work to ensure our educational programs reflect and encourage this diversity and inclusivity, and we welcome you to join us.

### Application Requirements
Applicants should submit: 
- Biographical information (filled out directly in the application portal).
- Current academic CV or résumé, including a list of publications, if any.
- An outline of a current or proposed research project in complex and/or computational social sciences (maximum one page).
- One academic letter of recommendation.
- Contact information for two additional academic references.
