### Summary
Organisms across the tree of life are afflicted by internal conflicts, where their constituent parts—from single genes to swathes of cells—are selected towards different ends. These internal struggles drive genetic and cellular selfishness, as seen  in e.g. meiotic drivers, imprinted genes, reproductive parasitism, and cancerous cells. The capacity of such selfish elements to distort phenotypic traits and genetic transmission is at odds with organismal adaptation and fitness. Despite their pervasive and profound impact, the study of internal conflicts has long taken place in an isolated manner. Different selfish elements have been studied within different communities, resulting in a range of distinct approaches, rather than a concerted effort fostering common terminology and methodology. This fragmented approach has hindered a proper evaluation of how internal conflicts affect organismal adaptation, both in theory and in practice.

In this special issue, we will explore the fundamentals of the study of internal conflicts with a focus on the following questions:
1. What would a common methodological framework for studying internal conflicts look like?
2. How can we connect theoretical and empirical work on internal conflicts?
3. Which hitherto unconsidered factors enhance or diminish the impact of internal conflicts on organismal function and adaptation?

All submissions spanning theoretical, empirical, and philosophical approaches are welcome. In particular, we invite primary research articles. Drawing on the most recent insights garnered by our community is essential to answering these fundamental questions.

Deadline for submission of manuscripts: 28th February 2026
