### General Info
NERCCS 2026: The Ninth Northeast Regional Conference on Complex Systems will follow the success of the previous NERCCS conferences to promote the emerging venue of interdisciplinary scholarly exchange for complex systems researchers in the Northeast U.S. region (and beyond) to share their research outcomes through presentations and online publications, network with their peers, and promote interdisciplinary collaboration and the growth of the research community.

NERCCS will particularly focus on facilitating the professional growth of early career faculty, postdocs, and students in the region who will likely play a leading role in the field of complex systems science and engineering in the coming years.

The 2026 conference will be held primarily in person at the University of Rochester, with an online participation option via Zoom.

### Call For Submissions
We call for submissions for oral and poster presentations on a wide variety of complex systems research. Relevant topics include (but are not limited to):
- Theoretical foundations of complex systems
- Nonlinear dynamics and chaos
- Systems theory, information theory, and systems science
- Game theory, decision theory, and socio-economical applications
- Self-organization, pattern formation, and collective behavior
- Structure and dynamics of complex networks
- Sustainability and adaptability of complex systems
- Bio-inspired systems, machine learning, and evolutionary computation
- Data-driven approaches to complex systems
- Applications to the humanities, art, and literature
- Historical and philosophical aspects of complex systems
- Complex systems and education

### Submission Guidelines
Submissions should be made as a single PDF file via the Google Form submission system, in extended abstract format (1 page, including one figure).

The full-paper publication option will also be available in the post-conference special issue in Northeast Journal of Complex Systems (NEJCS) (free of charge). Interested authors can contact the Publication Chairs (Georgi Georgiev and Bernard Ricca).

Best Oral Presentation / Best Poster Awards: NERCCS 2026 will offer the Best Oral Presentation and Best Poster Awards. The winner will be selected from accepted talks and posters by the judge panel, which will be recognized with a certificate at the conference.
