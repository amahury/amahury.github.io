### About
The Artificial Life, Intelligence, Complexity & Evolution, or ALICE workshop, is an interdisciplinary workshop bringing together researchers in complex systems and collective intelligence.

The fields of artificial life, collective intelligence, and evolution, span a wide range of scientific disciplines, yet, they share foundational ideas from complexity science such as self-organisation, network approaches, agentic perspectives, and bio-inspired paradigms of intelligence. The workshop provides a venue for researchers from these different communities to come together with the goal of exchanging ideas, tools, and problems.

The workshop is built around three pillars: collaboration through projects, interdisciplinarity—or rather, antidisciplinarity—, and community. The focus of the workshop is to create a stimulating environment to explore research ideas through discussion groups and projects—with the goal of spawning longer-term collaborations.

The discussion groups and the projects will be facilitated by the guest speakers.
