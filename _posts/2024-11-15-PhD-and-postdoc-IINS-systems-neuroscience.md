- Deadline: 31 December 2024
- City: Bordeaux
- Institution: Interdisciplinary Institute for Neuroscience (IINS – UMR 5927)

The Takahashi lab at the Interdisciplinary Institute for Neuroscience (IINS – UMR 5927), part of the Bordeaux Neurocampus, is seeking motivated postdocs and PhD students. Our lab, “Neural Basis of Perception,” investigates how cortical circuits process somatosensory information to shape tactile perception in mice (https://www.iins.u-bordeaux.fr/TAKAHASHI). We welcome applications from individuals passionate about exploring:
1. **Cortical top-down mechanisms in tactile perception**: Investigate how higher-order cortical areas modulate primary somatosensory cortex (S1) activity, allowing mice to detect behaviorally relevant stimuli in noisy sensory environments. This project aims to elucidate cortical top-down control of perceptual thresholds for detecting tactile stimuli in mice (see Takahashi et al., Science, 2016; Takahashi et al., Nat Neurosci, 2020).
2. **Adaptive cortical processes in embodiment**: Using a novel artificial whisker developed by our lab, we investigate “embodiment” in mice, opening new avenues to understand adaptive cortical processes.

To uncover these mechanisms at both cellular and systems levels, we use a wide range of in vivo techniques, including two-photon and wide-field one-photon imaging, Neuropixels recordings, optogenetics, and chemogenetics, combined with head-fixed mouse behavior. These projects are fully funded by ANR 2024, FRM Team 2024, and Cercle FSER.

Located within the Bordeaux Neurocampus—a dynamic hub of over 700 neuroscientists—our lab is fully equipped with in vivo two-photon and wide-field one-photon microscopes, and Neuropixels recording systems, with access to additional cutting-edge facilities on campus, including the Bordeaux Imaging Center (BIC). Candidates will benefit from an internationally connected, vibrant environment, including CAJAL Advanced Neuroscience Training courses (https://cajal-training.org/) hosted by the Neurocampus, and an open, collaborative lab culture committed to advancing each team member’s scientific career.

### What we offer
Join a dynamic, internationally diverse team. Initial postdoc contracts are for 2 years, with potential for extension. PhD positions are funded for 3 years, with the possibility of a 4th year. Salaries are based on the CNRS salary grid and adjusted for experience.

### Postdoc requirements
- PhD (or near completion) in experimental or computational neuroscience
- Experience with in vivo imaging or electrophysiology in rodents (advantageous)
- Proficiency in Matlab or Python programming
- Strong motivation, commitment, and teamwork skills
- Excellent communication skills in English (oral and writing)
- Although the position is fully funded, every person in our lab is encouraged to apply for personal grants if eligible

### PhD student requirements
- Master’s degree in experimental or computational neuroscience
- Programming skills in Matlab or Python (preferred)
- Strong motivation, commitment, and teamwork skills
- Excellent communication skills in English (oral and writing)
- Although the position is fully funded, every person in our lab is encouraged to apply for personal grants if eligible

### How to apply?
To apply, please send a cover letter detailing your research experience and interests, a CV, and contact information for two to three references to naoya.takahashi@u-bordeaux.fr. We will review and interview applicants on a rolling basis and will continue to accept applications until all positions are filled.
