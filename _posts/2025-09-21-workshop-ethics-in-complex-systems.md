### Aim
Complexity science studies how a large collection of components can spontaneously self-organize to exhibit non-trivial, unpredictable global structures and behaviors at larger scales, having many applications with daily life impacts, e.g., climate change, financial markets, healthcare, polarization, and technological networks. Characteristics of these systems, such as having non-linear emerging dynamics and being adaptive, pose unique ethical challenges, as traditional normative ethical approaches often struggle to account for such dynamic and intricate interactions.

This one-day interdisciplinary workshop aims at bridging the gap between researchers in complexity science and ethics and offers a new perspective on why ethics discussions are necessary in such a complex research realm.
