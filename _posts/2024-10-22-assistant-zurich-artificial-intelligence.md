The professorship will address pressing technical challenges posed by the widespread integration of machine learning and AI systems into society, and have a bridging role between technical AI research and the social sciences or humanities. It will delve into the intended and unintended societal consequences of AI systems and shape their development to align with ethical and legal standards and enhance human welfare.

Applicants should be strongly rooted in computer science, have internationally recognized expertise in their field, and pursue research at the forefront of computer science. Successful candidates should establish and lead a strong research program. Research areas of interest include, but are not limited to, theoretical and practical aspects of reliable and trustworthy AI systems; principles of human-AI and multi-agent interaction; steerability, alignment and safety of AI systems; interpretability of neural networks and other machine learning models; plausibility, verification, and accountability of generative AI; assessing and ensuring compliance of AI with policy and law; bias, fairness and privacy in machine learning; next-generation responsible AI systems, e.g., through enhanced reasoning capabilities. The new professor will be expected to supervise doctoral students and teach both undergraduate and graduate level courses (in German or in English). Collaboration in research and teaching is expected both within the department and with other groups of ETH Zurich and related institutions.

Assistant professorships have been established to promote the careers of younger scientists. ETH Zurich implements a tenure track system equivalent to that of other top international universities.

ETH Zurich is an equal opportunity and family-friendly employer, values diversity, and is responsive to the needs of dual-career couples.

Applications should include a curriculum vitae, a list of publications with the three most important ones marked, a statement of future research and teaching interests, a description of the leadership philosophy, a description of the three most important achievements*, the names of three references, and a certificate of the highest degree. The letter of application should be addressed to the President of ETH Zurich, Prof. Dr. Joël Mesot. The review of applications will begin in December 2024; we recommend submitting your application no later than 30 November 2024.
