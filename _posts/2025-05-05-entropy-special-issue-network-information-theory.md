### Introduction
Dear Colleagues,

With the development of information technologies in fields such as communication and artificial intelligence, scenarios involving multiple users and even complex networks dominate scientific research. For the core performance metrics of these scenarios, it is urgent to study their fundamental limits, namely network information theory. The research progress will also in turn promote technological advancements in practical applications.

In this Special Issue, we focus on (but are not limited to) characterizing the fundamental limits of core performance metrics related to multiuser and even networked scenarios, and designing schemes to approach these limits. According to different scenarios, these metrics include channel capacity, latency, reliability, complexity, secrecy, etc.

This Special Issue will accept unpublished original papers and comprehensive reviews focused on network information theory and its application.

### Submission Guidelines
Manuscripts should be submitted online at www.mdpi.com by registering and logging in to this website. Once you are registered, click here to go to the submission form. Manuscripts can be submitted until the deadline. All submissions that pass pre-check are peer-reviewed. Accepted papers will be published continuously in the journal (as soon as accepted) and will be listed together on the special issue website. Research articles, review articles as well as short communications are invited. For planned papers, a title and short abstract (about 100 words) can be sent to the Editorial Office for announcement on this website.

Submitted manuscripts should not have been published previously, nor be under consideration for publication elsewhere (except conference proceedings papers). All manuscripts are thoroughly refereed through a single-blind peer-review process. A guide for authors and other relevant information for submission of manuscripts is available on the Instructions for Authors page. Entropy is an international peer-reviewed open access monthly journal published by MDPI.

Please visit the Instructions for Authors page before submitting a manuscript. The Article Processing Charge (APC) for publication in this open access journal is 2600 CHF (Swiss Francs). Submitted papers should be well formatted and use good English. Authors may use MDPI's English editing service prior to publication or during author revisions.
