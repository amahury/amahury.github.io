### The position
The Embodied Cognitive Science Unit (ECSU), led by Dr. Tom Froese, is seeking a highly motivated Postdoctoral Researcher to contribute to innovative interdisciplinary research at the intersection of cognitive science, neuroscience, and philosophy. This position offers a unique opportunity to investigate the neural and physiological mechanisms underlying social interaction and decision-making through cutting-edge experiments and analyses.

The successful candidate will play a key role in advancing ongoing research into embodied cognition and collective decision-making, with a specific focus on integrating data from hyperscanning techniques (EEG, ECG, EDA, and respiration) and novel physiological measures, including gastric rhythms, to explore their impact on cognitive and social processes.

### About OIST
The Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University was established in 2011 to contribute to the development of science and technology worldwide and to serve as a hub of innovation in Okinawa. OIST is a dynamic new graduate university of science and technology in Okinawa Prefecture, Japan which offers a 5-year PhD program and brings together outstanding researchers from across the country and across disciplines to conduct cutting-edge scientific research.

The university is located on 85 hectares of protected forestland overlooking a beautiful shoreline and coral reefs. The campus is striking architecturally, and the facilities are outstanding. To facilitate multidisciplinary research, there are no academic departments. Outstanding resources and equipment are provided and managed to encourage easy access and collaboration.

English is the official language of the University, and the university research community is fully international, with more than 50 countries represented. OIST is rapidly gaining recognition in the worldwide academic community as a model for excellence in education and research, and our unwavering commitment to scientific and technological innovation is dedicated to generating progress that will fuel Okinawa's economic growth.

### Responsibilities
1. **Experimental Design and Execution:**
    - Lead the development and execution of EEG hyperscanning experiments using the Perceptual Crossing Paradigm and related setups.
    - Incorporate additional physiological measurements (e.g., gut activity) into experimental protocols to study their influence on cognition and social coordination.
2. **Data Analysis:**
    - Perform EEG (single brain and interbrain) data analysis, e.g. connectivity analysis, & signal complexity analysis.
    - Perform other physiological signal analysis (ECG, EDA, Respiration pattern, and gastric activity) and interpret the relationship between neural activity and other physiological activity during social processes.
    - Explore innovative statistical and computational models, such as optimal stopping theory and irruption theory, to interpret experimental findings.
3. **Collaboration:**
    - Work closely with an interdisciplinary team of neuroscientists, engineers, and cognitive scientists to refine experimental designs and integrate findings into broader theoretical frameworks.
    - Engage with collaborators at partner institutions, including those focusing on mental health applications of embodied cognition research.
4. **Dissemination:**
    - Publish high-quality research articles in peer-reviewed journals.
    - Present findings at international conferences and workshops.

### Qualifications
**Required:**
- PhD in Cognitive Science, Neuroscience, Psychology, Biomedical Engineering, or a related field.
- Proven expertise in EEG data collection and analysis.
- Strong programming skills in MATLAB, Python and/or related languages for data processing and statistical modeling.
- Demonstrated ability to design and conduct empirical research independently.

**Preferred:**
- Experience with hyperscanning EEG setups and non-linear time-series analysis.
- Familiarity with physiological data collection methods, including ECG, EDA, and gastric activity.
- Knowledge and experience in biological signal processing.
- Knowledge of embodied cognitive science and related theoretical frameworks.
- Publications in peer-reviewed journals demonstrating relevant expertise.

### Compensation and Benefits
For Postdoctoral Scholar the Expected Annual Salary is 4.5M-5.9M yen in accordance with the OIST Employee Compensation Regulations.

**Benefits:**
- Relocation, housing and commuting allowances
- Annual paid leave and summer holidays
- Health insurance (Private School Mutual Aid)
- Welfare pension insurance (kousei-nenkin)
- Worker's accident compensation insurance (roudousha-saigai-hoshou-hoken)
- Access to Child Development Center
- Access to Schooling Options
- Language Education
- Resource Center (Daily Life Support in Okinawa)
- Remote Work system

### Submission Documents
1. Cover letter outlining research interests and qualifications.
2. Curriculum Vitae (CV) including a list of publications.
3. Contact details of two referees (at least one must be a previous supervisor).
