### General info
The BottiniLab invites applications for a postdoctoral researcher position focusing on two projects:
1. Development of high-precision eye-tracking technology for closed-eye conditions using machine
learning and deep neural networks (DNNs).
2. Reconstruction of visual imagery (and potentially dreams) from non-invasive neuroimaging
techniques (fMRI/MEG), combined with machine learning-based eye-tracking technology.

The research offers promising applications in both academic and industrial contexts.

This position is for an initial term of 24 months, with the possibility of renewal pending available funding. We seek a postdoctoral fellow with strong interests and a solid background in brain decoding and the application of machine learning methods in neuroscience.

The eye-movement project (approximately 60-70% workload) involves training neural networks to map Electrooculography (EoG) signals onto concurrently recorded eye-tracking data. This approach aims to significantly enhance EoG precision and enable accurate eye-tracking even with eyes closed. This project is funded by an ERC Proof of Concept (PoC) grant.

The brain decoding project (approximately 30-40% workload) utilizes deep neural networks and diffusion models to decode visual information from neuroimaging data and generate images (pictures, short video) directly from brain activity. Our ultimate aim is to apply this technology to internally generated mental contents, including visual imagery, dreams, and lucid dreaming. This project is conducted in collaboration with Dr. Paolo Rota from the University of Trento.

### Our Offer 
The BottiniLab (http://www.bottinilab.com/) is an international research team comprising members from various regions worldwide. Our dynamic and growing group currently includes 3 postdocs, 4 Ph.D. students, and 2 research assistants. The working language at CIMeC is English, promoting an inclusive and globally connected research environment.

The CIMeC hosts state-of-the-art research facilities, including:
- Siemens Prisma 3T MRI scanner
- Magnetoencephalography (MEG) â€“ newly acquired with exceptional signal quality
- Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation combined with EEG (TMS-EEG)
- Advanced eye-tracking technology
- Human intracranial stereotactic EEG, facilitated through external collaborations with leading neurosurgical centers

Life in Trentino offers exceptional natural beauty, cultural vibrancy, and outstanding quality of life, making it an ideal location for both academic and personal growth (https://www.visittrentino.info/en).

### Application
Applicants must hold a Ph.D. and have substantial experience and interest in artificial neural networks and machine learning. Candidates without prior neuroscience experience but possessing strong computational skills are also encouraged to apply; relevant neuroscience training will be provided.

To express your interest, please email the lab manager, Lucia Albasini (lucia.albasini@unitn.it), and cc Roberto Bottini (roberto.bottini@unitn.it). Include the following documents:
- CV
- A brief research statement

Application Deadline: August 29th, 2025
