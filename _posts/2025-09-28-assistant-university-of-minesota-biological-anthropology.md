### About the Position
The Department of Anthropology in the College of Liberal Arts at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities invites applications for a full-time, tenure-track position in paleoanthropology beginning fall semester 2026. We seek scholars at the cutting edge of biological anthropology who critically utilize scientific approaches, broadly conceived, to answer anthropological questions related to the evolution and variation of humans and/or hominin ancestors. Possible research areas include hominin fossil record and skeletal anatomy, biomechanics and functional morphology, or evolutionary approaches to the study of human adaptations. Appointment will be 100% time over the nine-month academic year (late August to late May). The appointment will be made at the rank of tenure-track Assistant Professor, depending on qualifications and experience, and consistent with collegiate and University policy. 

Faculty in the Department of Anthropology in the College of Liberal Arts are expected to maintain an active program of scholarly research or creative activity that includes publications; teaching undergraduate and graduate level courses; advising students; pursuit of extramural funding; and service effort appropriate for the level of appointment to the department, college, university and profession. The holder of this position is expected to teach two courses per semester, which includes joining the teaching rotation for a large introductory course in biological anthropology, as well as developing specific undergraduate and graduate courses in the candidate’s area of expertise. We are especially interested in candidates who, broadly conceived, enhance diversity in the department and whose interests integrate with and expand on current department expertise in biological anthropology, and can interface with the four fields of anthropology.
