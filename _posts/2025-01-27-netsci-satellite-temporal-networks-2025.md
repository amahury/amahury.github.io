Temporal networks are powerful models for understanding dynamical systems where entities and interactions appear and vanish as time goes by. Unlike static networks, which simply provide a snapshot of a system, temporal networks can provide insights into how the structure changes and how this affects network processes. Incorporating the timing, order, and duration of connections is critical in a wide range of applications, from routing traffic on mobility networks to predicting and hindering the spread of infectious diseases. 

Interest in temporal networks has grown rapidly across disciplines, fueled by advances in (big) data collection and computational tools. Despite significant progress, however, there is still much to be done to fully harness their potential.

At TENET (TEmporal NETworks), we welcome contributions to advancing temporal network research, focusing on novel methods, models, and applications. The satellite will bring together researchers from various disciplines to share innovative methodologies, theoretical advances, and empirical insights into how networks change, adapt, and respond to internal and external pressures.

### Topics
We welcome contributions on Temporal Networks (also referred to as Dynamic Graphs, Stream Graphs, Time-Varying Networks, Evolving Networks, or Link Streams) applied to any real-world contexts, in conjunction with various fields, such as:
- Dynamic community detection
- Event detection
- Signed Networks
- Higher-order interactional data
- Network Data Collection
- Software for temporal graph analysis
- Graph machine learning
- Link prediction
- Modeling fairness and ethics
- Network Measures And Metrics

Studies that combine complexity and temporal networks that do not fall within the above are also welcome!

### Authors Guidelines
We encourage the submission of abstracts to be considered for regular talks and posters. Participants can submit an abstract from published/unpublished research that has not been submitted to the Netsci main track as any type of presentation using the Microsoft CMT (button below).  

Submissions should be at most one page long in PDF format (including references and only one figure) and should include title, author(s), and affiliation(s). Submissions that do not conform to these requirements will not be reviewed. 

Submitted abstracts will be evaluated and selected according to adherence with the theme of the satellite, originality of the research, and scientific soundness.

We will also present the Best Talk/Poster Award among all satellite contributions.

Selected contributions will be invited to submit to a dedicated Special Issue, Evolution of Networks, for the Applied Network Science journal.

### Important Dates
- Submission deadline: February 7, 2025
- Notification date: February 14, 2025
- Early-bird registration to Netsci25: February 24, 2025
- Event: 2 June, 2025
