### About
This meeting aims to gather an international group of theoreticians and experimentalists from cognitive science, psychology, developmental biology, artificial life, computer science, neuroscience, and philosophy to examine the state of the art in the phenomenon of agency and its manifestation across different scales, from cells to society. The focus will be on exploring shared organizational principles connecting diverse expressions of agency and the interaction between them. By drawing on strong theoretical foundations of cognitive agency at the individual human level, the goal is to investigate whether these insights can open new perspectives on smaller (e.g., cells) and larger living systems (e.g., ecologies), and vice versa. The outcomes of this inquiry can enhance our interacting with and shaping of biological regulation at all scales, with broad implications for health-giving interventions.

We are pleased to extend an invitation for contributions from all disciplines embracing the embodied approach. Although the focus of our keynotes is on the topic of agency across scales, we welcome submissions on all topics related to embodied cognitive science.

Please bookmark this page and stay tuned to our social media for updates.

### Application 
There are two types of contribution: talk and poster. You will be able to select your preference, and we will make as much as possible to arrange your work if accepted.

When filling out the application [form](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=jfvA2Fa7u0SfSsWOdGVlLodA_aBsH91HgOIXAIFI_9xUQkFDWE0wOEtPVEExWTMwUE1VODBPVVkwRy4u&route=shorturl) you should submit an abstract of maximum 250 words, which explains your work and how it would be relevant into the event.
