We are excited to announce a Ph.D. position available at the Center for Mind and Brain Sciences (CIMeC) at the University of Trento, Italy. The position focuses on cutting-edge research combining computational neuroscience and generative artificial intelligence, specifically targeting the reconstruction of mental imagery and dream content directly from neural activity.

Ideal candidates will have: 
- Strong motivation for scientific research and innovation.
- Excellent teamwork and collaborative skills.
- Independent and critical thinking abilities.
- A background in Machine Learning, Generative AI, or Computational Neuroscience.

The project is co-supervised by Roberto Bottini (www.bottinilab.com) and Paolo Rota (https://paolorota.eu). 

CIMeC provides exceptional neuroimaging research facilities, including:
- 3T MRI Siemens Prisma.
- A state-of-the-art Magnetoencephalography (MEG) system.
- Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation combined with EEG (TMS-EEG).
- Advanced eye-tracking technology.
- Virtual/augmented reality devices and GPU HPC cluster.

All facilities are exclusively dedicated to research, ensuring optimal conditions for your Ph.D. studies.

Joining our labs means becoming part of an international and vibrant research community. English is our working language, and we maintain extensive international collaborations. You will have numerous opportunities to engage in conferences, workshops, and global scientific events supported by significant research funding from prestigious international grants.

Life in Trentino combines exceptional natural beauty, cultural vibrancy, and outstanding quality of life, creating an ideal environment for both your academic and personal development.

If you are interested in joining our innovative research effort, please send an informal inquiry, including your CV and a brief statement of research interests, to roberto.bottini@unitn.it or paolo.rota@unitn.it

The official call will be announced in May 2025, and the Ph.D. program (4 years) is expected to begin in November 2025. However, an earlier start is possible.
