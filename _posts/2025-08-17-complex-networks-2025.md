The International Conference on Complex Networks and their Applications aims at bringing together researchers from different scientific communities working on areas related to complex networks. Two types of contributions are welcome: theoretical developments arising from practical problems, and case studies where methodologies are applied. Both contributions are aimed at stimulating the interaction between theoreticians and practitioners.

### Important Dates
- Submission deadline: September 02, 2025 
- Acceptance Notification: October 03, 2025
- Camera Ready: October 12, 2025
- Registration: October 17, 2025

### Topics
Authors are encouraged to submit both theoretical and applied papers on their research in complex networks. Topics for the conference include, but are not limited to:
- Models of Complex Networks
- Structural Network Properties
- Dynamics on and of Complex Networks
- Community Structure and Discovery
- Complex Networks and Epidemics
- Multiplex Networks
- Temporal and Spatial Networks
- Network Controllability
- Link Prediction
- Resilience and Robustness
- Synchronization in Networks
- Information Spreading in Social Media
- Algorithms for Network Analysis
- Network Medicine

### Contributions
Two types of contributions are accepted: Full Paper and Extended Abstract. We will not accept any paper that, at the time of submission, is under review or has already been published or accepted for publication in a journal or conference. This restriction does not apply to extended abstracts since they are not targeted for publication in the proceedings. The review process is single-blind.

- Full Paper: Recommended to be between 8-10 pages. They should not exceed 12 pages in total including bibliography.
- Extended Abstract: Recommended to be between 2-3 pages. They should not exceed 4 pages.

All submitted contributions will be carefully evaluated based on originality, significance, technical soundness, and clarity of expression by at least two reviewers. The organizers will examine the reviews and make the final papers selection.

Full papers accepted for publication will be published by Springer-Verlag on the Studies in Computational Intelligence Series. Authors will be required to transfer copyright to Springer. The books of this series are submitted for indexing to SCOPUS, DBLP, MathSciNet, Zentralblatt Math, MetaPress, Ulrichs and Springerlink.

Accepted Extended Abstracts will be published in the Book of Abstract along with the abstracts of the keynote presentations.

### Venue
Located in the Southern Tier of New York State near the Pennsylvania border, Binghamton lies at the confluence of the Susquehanna and Chenango Rivers.

Known as the "Carousel Capital of the World" and once a cradle of American industry, Binghamton blends historic charm with cultural vibrancy. Its walkable downtown, surrounding hills, and lively festivals such as the LUMA Projection Arts Festival and Spiedie Fest offer a welcoming atmosphere for both residents and visitors.

Binghamton University, part of the State University of New York (SUNY) system, is a highly regarded public research institution known for its academic excellence, interdisciplinary programs, and commitment to innovation. Often ranked among the top public universities in the United States, it offers a wide range of undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral programs across six schools, including arts and sciences, engineering, business, and public affairs.
