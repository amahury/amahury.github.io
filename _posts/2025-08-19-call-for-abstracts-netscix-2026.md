We are pleased to invite submissions for the NetSci-X Conference 2026, which will focus on shedding light on and fostering the disciplinary, social, and cultural diversity within network science. This conference will highlight the diversity of disciplines, cultures, and social frameworks that contribute to the advancement of network science. We invite researchers from a wide range of fields to share insights on how network science can deepen our understanding of societal, cultural, and disciplinary networks.

### Topics 
We invite submissions in the form of a two-page extended abstract (maximum), which must include a figure, references, and a discussion of the ethical considerations related to your work. By default, submissions will be considered for either an Oral or Poster Presentation, unless a preference for a Lightning Talk is indicated.

Submissions are open to a wide range of topics within network science, including but not limited to:

Adaptive Networks, Algorithms on Networks, Biological and Ecological Networks, Communities and Mesoscale Structures, Computational Social Sciences, Diffusion, Spreading, and Transport, Diverse Lives and Network Science , Dynamics on and of Networks, Earth Science and Climate Networks, Economic and Financial Networks, Graph Mining and Large Graph Analytics, Generative Agent-based Modeling , Higher-Order Interactions, Indigenous Concerns in Network Science , Link Prediction and Ranking, Machine Learning and Networks, Mobility and Urban Networks, Models of Complex Networks, Multilayer and Multiplex Networks, Network Analysis and Measures, Network Embedding and Geometry, Network Epidemiology, Network Inequality and Fairness , Network Neuroscience and Medicine, Network Science and Education, Network Visualisation, Networks and Innovation, Patterns and Signal Detection, Percolation, Resilience, Phase Transitions, Population Health and Public Health , Science of Science, Social Groups and Political Networks, Social Networks and Opinion Dynamics, Statistical Inference on Networks, Synchronization and Control, Technological and Infrastructure Networks, Temporal and Spatial Networks.

### Submission guidelines
Deadline: 5th September 2025, 23:59 AoE. (submission system opens 4th June 2025)

Submissions must follow the Paper Template and be submitted via OpenReview

All abstracts must be anonymous and written in English.

The use of large language models (LLMs) is restricted to research applications (e.g., audits, generative agent-based modeling) and editorial support. AI assistance may involve wording and formatting adjustments but excludes autonomous content creation or generative editorial work. Human oversight is required for the final version, and authors must confirm that the edits align with their original intent.

### Review Process
Each submission will undergo evaluation by a minimum of two reviewers, who will remain anonymous to both the authors and each other. We welcome submissions of both published work and ongoing research with preliminary results. Submissions will be assessed based on their relevance to the conference theme, scientific quality, potential impact, and suitability for the selected presentation format (i.e., oral presentation, poster, lightning talk). Authors are encouraged to indicate their preferred format(s), and the program committee will make the final decision at its discretion.

### Selection Process
The conferenceâ€™s programme committee will select contributions based on the peer review process. Selected submissions will be presented at the conference as an oral presentation, lightning talk, or a poster.

### Conference Attendance
For each accepted abstract, at least one author must register for the main conference and present the paper in person.
