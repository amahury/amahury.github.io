This is the third edition of the EDAI workshop, after its success in 2024 in Santiago de Compostela (Spain), and in 2023 in Kraków (Poland). Our mission remains the same: Social, cooperative and hybrid AI have increasingly gained attention. Researchers imagine ecosystems wherein (artificial) intelligent agents and humans interact and make decisions, addressing simultaneously, either individually or collectively, a range of heterogeneous problems. To handle the complex dynamics inherent to such systems, and to ensure that results are globally beneficial, research into AI design and analysis methods is needed. This workshop aims to connect the traditions of single- and multi-agent AI research (reasoning, learning, ...) to the areas of (eco-)evolutionary dynamics, typically investigated in the context of complex systems. We hope to foster collaboration and cross-fertilisation of ideas among these communities to advance the areas of social, cooperative and hybrid AI.

### EDAI - Workshop at ECAI 2025
Research agendas have been announced around social, cooperative and hybrid AI wherein ecosystems are imagined where intelligent agents and humans interact and make decisions, addressing simultaneously a collection of heterogeneous problems. Such an imagined world implicitly assumes that the personal beliefs, observed behaviours and potentially the mechanisms for decision-making themselves evolve over time. Depending on the type of encounters and the frequency of different types of participants, different outcomes can be imagined and these outcomes may turn out to be beneficial or detrimental to society. As developers of AI systems, one thus needs to be aware of the complex macro evolutionary dynamics potentially generated in such ecosystems, even when the design is happening at the micro-scale.

We see here an opportunity to connect the traditions of single- and multi-agent AI research (symbolic, probabilistic, …) to the area of evolutionary dynamics and eco-evolutionary dynamics. The purpose of this workshop is therefore to promote collaboration and cross-fertilisation of ideas between AI researchers and researchers typically working on questions related to behavioural dynamics based on Evolutionary Game Theory and Complex Systems.

The workshop invites high-quality abstracts and papers covering all aspects at the intersection of evolutionary dynamics with social, cooperative and hybrid AI. The following list is a non-exhaustive selection of topics:
- Behavioural evolution and learning
- Belief evolution and learning
- Learning in evolving environments
- Evolution, cognition, and reasoning
- Learning to learn from whom
- Complex dynamics in learning ecosystems
- Delegation and principal-agent problem in AI
- Evolution and communication
- Behavioural experiments on social and cooperative AI
- Norm dynamics in hybrid ecosystems
- Trust in evolving AI eco-systems
- Decision-making and emotions
- Dynamics in AI development ecosystems
- Networks in learning and evolution
- Evolution of cooperation with and through AI

### Important Dates

You can make your submission through EasyChair. We will accept the following submission types:

1. Full Submissions (max. 7 pages not considering refs):
   - Original full papers: This must be unpublished work
   - Transfers from ECAI: papers submitted to ECAI which have not been accepted. Please attach the PDF of your submission and the reviews you received.
   - Papers accepted in ECAI: if your paper has been accepted in ECAI, we welcome you to also present it at our workshop. Please attach proof of acceptance and the reviews you have received together with your article.

2. Work in progress (max. 5 pages not considering refs):
   - Preliminary results: this format is intended for work in progress which you would like to discuss during the workshop and receive feedback.
   - Visionary outlook articles (blue-sky).   

3. Extended Abstracts (1-2 pages not considering refs):
   - Extended abstract for articles already published in a journal in the last two years.
   - PhD/Early career researchers Highlights: this format is intended for PhD students and early post-doctoral researchers to present ideas for discussion.

In function of the number of submissions you might be selected for a talk or a poster presentation.
