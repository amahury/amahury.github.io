### About the project
VirHoX addresses a major challenge in virology: linking newly discovered viruses to their host species. The project aims to develop VirHo-seq, a universal method based on the conserved biological interaction between viral mRNA and host ribosomes during translation, enabling direct virus-host assignment across all domains of life.

Your role will focus on WP9 (RiboTools functional testing), a critical work package that validates the enzymatic toolkit at the single-molecule level: you will use single-molecule TIRF (smTIRF) microscopy to validate the activity and specificity of engineered enzymes (Cas variants, among others) on ribosome-bound RNA substrates. This direct, real-time validation ensures that molecular tools developed for VirHo-seq function reliably across diverse host-virus systems. You will establish ribosome immobilization strategies for multiple species, measure binding and cleavage kinetics at single-ribosome resolution, and ensure the broad applicability of RiboTools across bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic ribosomes.

This work provides the mechanistic foundation that transforms VirHo-seq from a promising concept into a broadly deployable platform for virus-host association discovery.

### Key responsabilities 
1. Establish single-molecule fluorescence microscopy assays to measure binding, cleavage, and release kinetics of engineered enzymes on individual ribosomes.
2. Develop and optimize ribosome immobilization strategies using both genetic and non-genetic approaches.
3. Purify and prepare ribosomes from diverse species (bacterial, archaeal, eukaryotic) for single-molecule observation.
4. Design and execute FRET-based assays to monitor rRNA cleavage efficiency and detect functional changes using antibiotic-binding probes.
5. Collaborate closely with VirHoX consortium partners. This will include period meetings and research exchange visits.
6. Present findings at international conferences and contribute to high-impact publications.
7. Mentor junior researchers and contribute to training activities within the consortium.

### Candidate profile
We are looking for a researcher who:
1. Holds (or is about to obtain) a PhD in molecular biology, biochemistry, or a related field.
2. Fulfills formal criteria outlined in NCN regulations (paragraph 2, point 2.1.1): https://shorturl.at/qMQYr
3. Has strong expertise in ribosome biochemistry. Experience in studying RNA-protein interactions and microscopy is highly valued.
4. Demonstrates strong experimental skills, independence, and creativity in research.
5. Has a solid publication record in peer-reviewed journals.
6. Communicates fluently in English (written and oral).
7. Is enthusiastic about interdisciplinary collaboration in an international environment.

### Selection criteria
Applications will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
1. Education and formal qualifications.
2. Technical expertise and relevance of experience to the project.
3. Scientific achievements (e.g., publications, awards, grants, international collaborations).
4. Proficiency in English (written and spoken).

### Our offer
1. Full-time employment for 6 months with the possibility of extension for the duration of WP9 (16 months total). Further extension for an additional 14-16 months is possible.
2. Competitive salary of approximately 9700 PLN gross/month.
3. 13th salary after working for at least 6 calendar months in a given year, private medical care, and Multisport benefit.
4. 100% research focus - no teaching duties.
5. Support from a lab manager and technical assistant.
6. Access to cutting-edge equipment (custom-built TIRF microscope, core facilities).
7. Strong mentorship toward independent funding applications (e.g., NCN, EMBO, MSCA).
8. Opportunities for international training, courses, and conferences.

Deadline: January 11, 2026
