### Job description
Human cognition is highly adaptive and can reason flexibly with new information. A crucial element for this is our working memory: a quick, reliable, and flexible system to maintain information temporarily, as needed, when needed. The goal of this project is to advance the understanding of how working memory is implemented in the human brain. To this end, the main objective is to develop a neural model of human working memory.

During the project, we will follow an intertwined model-experimental approach. First, we will use electroencephalography (EEG) experiments to investigate the neural basis of human working memory. Although it was long thought that working memory relied exclusively on active neural mechanisms that store information through continuous neural spiking, it was recently discovered that activity-silent mechanisms, such as short-term synaptic plasticity, also play an important role. We will experimentally target these two mechanisms, using EEG in combination with machine learning to reveal working memory contents held within. Second, we will use computational spiking-neuron models to explain the results of the experiments and implement the neural mechanisms responsible. These models will also shed light on the functional significance of having two mechanisms of working memory storage and how they are employed: we hypothesize that these exist to balance energy use, speed of information access, and susceptibility to interference.

The objective of this 4-year PhD position is the production of a number of research articles in peer-reviewed scientific journals and conference proceedings, which together will form the basis of a thesis leading to a PhD degree (Dr) at the University of Groningen.

### Workplace 
Founded in 1614, the University of Groningen enjoys an international reputation as a dynamic and innovative institution of higher education offering high-quality teaching and research. Flexible study programmes and academic career opportunities in a wide variety of disciplines encourage the 34,000 students and researchers alike to develop their own individual talents. As one of the best research universities in Europe, the University of Groningen has joined forces with other top universities and networks worldwide to become a truly global centre of knowledge.

This 4-year PhD position is embedded in the Artificial Intelligence department at the Faculty of Science and Engineering and in the department of Experimental Psychology at the Faculty of Behavioural and Social Sciences. The candidate will work under the shared supervision of Prof Dr Jelmer Borst (Artificial Intelligence) and Prof Dr Elkan Akyürek (Experimental Psychology).

### Qualifications
The successful candidate should have:
- a keen interest in the human brain, cognition, and formal methods to investigate these.
- a master’s degree or equivalent in cognitive or computational neuroscience, artificial intelligence, psychology or a related field.
- strong programming skills.
- experience in experiments with human participants is preferred.
- good analytical skills and a positive attitude towards interdisciplinary work.

### Conditions of employment
We offer you, following the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities
- a salary of € 2,770 gross per month in the first year, up to a maximum of € 3,539 gross per month in the fourth and final year for a full-time working week.
- a holiday allowance of 8% gross annual income and an 8.3% year-end bonus.
- Teaching: employed PhD candidates are expected to spend 10% of their working hours on teaching and/or supervising candidates.
- a full-time position (1.0 FTE). The successful candidate will first be offered a temporary position of one year with the option of renewal for another three years. Prolongation of the contract is contingent on sufficient progress in the first year to indicate that a successful completion of the PhD thesis within the next three years is to be expected. A PhD training programme is part of the agreement and the successful candidate will be enrolled in the Graduate School of Science and Engineering and in the Research School for Behavioral and Cognitive Neurosciences.

### Application
Application should include:
- letter of motivation.
- CV (including contact information for at least two academic references).
- transcripts from your bachelor’s and master’s degree.

You may apply for this position until 17 August 11:59pm / before 18 August 2025 Dutch local time (CEST) by means of the application form (click on "Apply" below on the advertisement on the university website).

Applications received before 18 August 2025 will be given full consideration; however, the position will remain open until it is filled.

For additional information you can contact Jelmer Borst, j.p.borst@rug.nl
