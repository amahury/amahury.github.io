### General info
Founded in 1607, Justus Liebig University Giessen (JLU) is a research university rich in tradition. Inspired by curiosity about the unknown, we enable around 25,000 students and 5,800 employees to advance science for society. Join us in breaking new ground and writing success stories –your own and those of our university.

Support us as of now in part-time position (65 %) as a Doctoral Researcher (PhD Position, m/f/d) Neural Circuits and Behavior. This position is limited in accordance with § 2 WissZeitVG and § 72 HessHG, offering the opportunity for individual academic qualification and with the goal of obtaining a doctorate. It is based in the newly established Animal Neurophysiology group (Prof. Münch) at the Institute of Animal Physiology, at the Faculty of Biology and Chemistry. The salary is in accordance with the collective labour agreement of the State of Hessen (E 13 TV-H).

As long as the maximum permissible duration of a fixed-term contract is not exceeded, you will be employed for an initial period of 3 years. An extension for up to another 2 years is possible under the above-mentioned condition.

### The Research Group
The advertised position is based in the newly founded Münch Lab (Animal Neurophysiology) at Justus Liebig University Giessen. We investigate how olfactory and taste signals are processed in the insect brain, particularly in Drosophila melanogaster, and how these signals are translated into goal-directed behavior. We use state-of-the-art approaches including functional brain imaging, automated behavioral analysis, and computational neuroanatomy. We value a collaborative atmosphere, early responsibility, and the targeted promotion of scientific development for all team members.

### Your tasks at a glance
In this role, you will take on diverse and exciting responsibilities, including services in research and teaching (§ 72 HessHG), while also advancing your professional and didactic qualifications.

You will teach courses in "Animal Physiology" and "Neurobiology" and research the neuronal processing of chemosensory stimuli and their influence on feeding behavior in Drosophila melanogaster. You will utilize modern imaging techniques, automated behavioral analysis, and/or computational neuroanatomy based on the fly connectome.

You will actively supervise theses and support the academic development of students.

### Your qualifications and competences
The key requirements for this position are curiosity and a genuine enthusiasm for biology, especially neurobiology. We are looking for dedicated individuals with a completed academic degree, ideally in the life or natural sciences. Experience with Drosophila, fluorescence microscopy, behavioral experiments, or a solid background in neurobiology is advantageous but not essential, we offer comprehensive support, training, and learning opportunities to acquire all necessary knowledge and a broad range of skills for the successful completion of the project. Basic knowledge of data analysis or programming and good English skills are desirable. We value independent working styles and encourage candidates who are eager to contribute to our team in a dynamic and collaborative manner. Open exchange and a supportive team environment are key to our shared success.

### Our offer to you
- You can expect a varied role within a young, dynamic team with opportunities for shaping the work environment
- Flexible working hours allow for individual work planning
- Free use of local public transport (LandesTicket Hessen)
- More than 100 training seminars, workshops and e-learning opportunities per year for personal development, as well as a wide range of health and sports activities
- Remuneration according to TV-H, company pension scheme, child allowance and special payments
- Good compatibility of family and career (certificate "audit familiengerechte hochschule")
