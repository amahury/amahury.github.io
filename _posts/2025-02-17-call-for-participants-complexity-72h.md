We are glad to announce the sixth edition of the Complexity72h workshop, which will take place in Madrid, Spain, in 23-27 June 2025. Complexity72h is an interdisciplinary workshop for young researchers in complex systems. Participants form teams and carry out projects in a three days’ time, i.e. 72 hours. The goal of each team is to upload on the arXiv (or similar repositories) a report of their work by the end of the event. Previous editions  were a success: 26 out of 26 projects have become arXiv preprints and new collaborations have been born.  We are now back for the 2025 edition, which will take place in Madrid at Carlos III University of Madrid on June 23-27.

### Application
Application deadline is 28 Feb 2025. You will need to give us some information about yourself, including your CV and a motivation letter, which you will upload as PDF files (see below for guidelines on writing your motivation letter). We will also ask you to rate each project and to select a double or single room (and the associated fee). At this stage, we cannot guarantee your room selection, as the number of single and double rooms is fixed. We will assign single and double rooms to those accepted on a first-come, first-served basis: the earlier you register, the higher the chance you will get the room you want. But do not worry: everybody will get accommodation! 

Tell us who you are, what you are currently doing, what you hope to take home from the workshop, and how you can contribute to it. Don’t worry if your CV is not fat. Complexity72h is looking for committed, hardworking and curious people! The motivation letter should be a maximum of 1 page in standard format (A4 or US Letter).

To keep a good participant-to-tutor ratio, and form groups of optimal size, we will select a maximum of around 40–50 participants. We aim at having participants coming from different stages of their careers: Master’s students, PhD students, and postdocs. We thus encourage Master and young PhD students to apply! We will notify the result of the selection process shortly after the closing of the call for participants. If you are accepted, we will then ask you to confirm your presence by paying the participation fee – we will give you all the details when we notify acceptance. If you are on the waiting list, we will let you know if spots become available as soon as we can.

- Double room fee: 350 Euros
