### About
Under the leadership of General Director Roger D. Kornberg and co-directors Christof Koch, Idan Segev, and Mickey London, participants will delve into five groundbreaking areas: Brain-Machine Interfaces (BMI), psychedelics, artificial intelligence, organoid research, and consciousness studies.

The program will feature a dynamic blend of foundational and advanced lectures, paired with interactive master classes where students will collaborate directly with leading scientists to envision the future of neuroscience. Our mission is to inspire transformative breakthroughs and foster innovative collaborations that will expand our understanding of the brain in both health and disease.
