### Application
The application process for the CENTURI PhD Program follows a structured timeline designed to guide candidates from project discovery to final selection and integration into the CENTURI community.

Key Steps and Dates:
- 14 November – Projects Publication & Call for Applications Opens: A list of available PhD projects will be published on the CENTURI website. Candidates are invited to explore the projects and submit their applications.
- 28 January – Application Deadline: All application materials must be submitted by this date. Late submissions will not be considered.
- 10 March – Application Results: Selected candidates will be notified and invited to the interview stage.
- 25 & 26 March – Interviews: Shortlisted candidates will participate in interviews with CENTURI and project supervisors.
- 30 March – Interview Results: Final decisions will be communicated to candidates following the interview process.
- 6 & 7 May – Campus Visit for Selected Candidates: Admitted candidates will be invited to visit the CENTURI campus, meet with their future teams, and discover the research environment.

This process ensures a transparent and competitive selection of motivated PhD students ready to engage in interdisciplinary research within the CENTURI community.

### PhD Program
PhD students are registered for their PhD in one of Aix-Marseille University doctoral schools (Healh and Life Sciences, Physics and Sciences of the Matter, Mathematics and Computer Science, etc.), leading to a PhD degree from Aix-Marseille University. The doctoral school is usually determined by the PhD student’s host laboratories.

As a general rule, PhDs in France last for three years. Students have the opportunity to apply for a 4th year of funding (mainly through external sources of funding, although internal options also exist), on a competitive basis.

PhD students are not required to teach during their PhD. However, they can apply to Aix-Marseille University to teach a maximum of 64 hours / year.
