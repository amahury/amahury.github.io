### General Info
Johns Hopkins University is anticipating being able to hire a postdoctoral fellow to work with Sean M. Carroll in Physics, Philosophy, and their intersection. Candidates could work in a number of areas in the foundations of physics or the study of complex systems, including quantum foundations, the emergence of spacetime, theoretical cosmology, origin and evolution of complexity, entropy and information, and the physics of social systems.

We seek intellectually ambitious candidates with initiative and the ability to work both collaboratively and independently in a vibrant and interactive environment. Candidates would be able to interact with a number of related faculty in theoretical physics (including cosmology, particles and fields, gravitation theory, and artificial intelligence) and the philosophy department, as well as participating in the growing Natural Philosophy Forum.

Applications will be due December 1st, 2025. Starting date is September 1st, 2026 (somewhat flexible).

A Ph.D. in physics, philosophy, or a related field (obtained before starting) is required. Johns Hopkins is an affirmative action/equal opportunity employer, and welcomes applications from women and members of underrepresented groups.
